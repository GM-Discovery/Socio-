# Socio- Starter Module: The Locked Courtyard

---

## üìñ Book Blurb (Read First)

**Welcome to Socio-: Stories of Us.**
You are locked in a courtyard. That much is certain.
But everything else‚Äîwhy you‚Äôre here, who you are, and what lies beyond the heavy door‚Äîis yours to discover.

This is not a test of combat. It is a test of character.

Let the story begin.

## Scenario Hook
Gather your friends, get ready to tell a story together. 
Pick a Narrator. Players are helping tell a story by controlling characters in the narrator's story. Pass this document to the Narrator. Give the narrator some time to read the instructions (5-15 minutes or so)

### Narrator Instructions
    Read these kinds of sections in this format aloud to the players when you're ready for it.

Don't read these instructions to players. This module is written for someone that's never played a TTRPG before. It is suggested you read at least the first page through the end of the ### What's Beyond the Door section before running the game.

### Opening: Setting the Scene

After you're ready, begin below.

**Read this to your players:**

    Your characters are locked in a courtyard. We start there. Everyone is trying to leave at the same time and will find out the door is locked. Before we do that, you must figure out your character. I will now pass out character sheets. Your character can do whatever you would like to do in this courtyard. You can meet the other players' characters in the crowd, practice your skills, purchase equipment that is available, or otherwise prepare for the challenge of the locked door.

Narrators must now decide how they want to play the game. Players can take the characters presented at the end of this scenario and pass out pre-generated character sheets. Or you can read the core rules Chapters 1 and 2 to have players make their own characters. Once you have completed character selection, you should continue to The Courtyard Marketplace to help give equipment to the characters.  

    This scene teaches gameplay one layer at a time: exploration, shopping, social interaction, skill rolls, and confrontation. 

You don‚Äôt need to explain everything upfront‚Äîjust let them try things. This courtyard is your practice arena.

### The Courtyard Marketplace

Read to players:

    "The ancient stone courtyard stretches before you, enclosed by high walls. Market stalls fill the space creating a maze of commerce and conversation. The air smells of roasted meat and the sharp tang of metalwork. Merchants call their wares while customers haggle.

    The only exit is a massive ironbound oak door, currently standing open, through which you all entered via a long causeway. People in authority lean against the walls, keeping a casual eye on the crowds."

**For players with Empathy 6+:** The general mood is relaxed but slightly anxious - merchants are eager to make sales before the day ends, and travelers seem hurried to complete their business.

**Narrator Note - Metagaming:** Metagaming means using information your character wouldn't have to make decisions. If you tell one player something their character knows, other players shouldn't act on that information unless their characters learn it naturally through conversation or observation. It is strongly urged not to metagame, including sharing the numerical values of your character unless prompted.

### Navigation Guide

- **If players want to browse and purchase equipment before investigating the door:** Go to section ### Equipment and Economics
- **If players want to interact with NPCs:** Several merchants and travelers are available for roleplay below the story.
- **If players want to practice skills or test mechanics:** Let them experiment freely
- **When ALL players are ready to check the door:** Go to 

### What's Behind the Door
Narrators should plan for what is beyond this door. This is a tutorial hook, generic enough to fit a wide variety of worlds. If you have a story to tell, this is how to get started. If you have no story whatsoever and want one provided for you, such the web for Socio- and you're sure to find options. This book will help you wing it by giving you a few prompts in an appendix near the end.

1. What kind of story do you want to tell?
2. What is the setting, where does it take place?
3. What are the people there like?
4. Are there friction points in your story? (e.g. inner turmoil, injustices, enemies, missing survival elements, et cetera)

There is more guidance available on world building in other volumes by many authors.

When you're ready to proceed with the story

    ‚ÄúThe oak door is heavy, reinforced with black iron bands. There‚Äôs no visible lock on this side.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúIf you want to try to push it, tell me how hard your character tries‚Äîjust casually pushing, shoving with your whole body, or doing something clever. Then we‚Äôll roll to see if you succeed.‚Äù

#### CORE MECHANIC
    To attempt something uncertain, roll your skill die. If the result meets or exceeds the Target Value (TV), you succeed. If not, you fail‚Äîbut failure is part of the story.

    Characters start with a d4 skill in every skill. If they were trained in a skill through character creation, they have a d6 in the skill, which means their odds of success are higher.

TV	Difficulty	Approx. Odds	Notes
1	Trivial	No roll	Succeeds automatically
2	Easy	~75%	Most trained characters succeed
3	Moderate	~50%	Even odds
4	Hard	~25%	Most characters fail without help
5+	Nearly Impossible	~<10%	Requires narrative brilliance or luck

Rolls are primarily based on the skill die, not the attribute. Attributes only enter the math if explicitly called for‚Äîtypically through a specific card effect, helper rule, or derived mechanic.

Players should fail on their first attempts at opening the door unless doing something extraordinaire. If they succeed, have them interrupted before getting the door fully open, or if they fail, then read the following.

    "One of the local authority figures has walked past and seen you at the door. They call out from a distance at you as they start approaching directly and quickly, "Hey, stop that! What are you doing?" The figure is using the "Command" Stance.

Social Conflict: Understanding Stances
    The figure approaching you has taken a Command stance‚Äîassertive, authoritative, expecting compliance. In Socio-, when stakes are high and words matter, every participant chooses a Social Stance before speaking or acting.

    Your stance is how you enter the space between you and the other. There are five.

    üåø Sympathy
    You offer connection.
    You seek resonance‚Äîemotional, relational, or cultural. Sympathy is not weakness; it‚Äôs risk. To use it well, you must mean it, or fake it well enough to matter. Works best when others are rigid or disconnected.

    ‚ÄúI get it. I‚Äôve been there. That‚Äôs not what we want, is it?‚Äù

    üîé Insight
    You observe.
    You‚Äôre watching more than speaking‚Äîtrying to understand what‚Äôs really happening beneath the surface. Insight works on patterns, silences, tells. It's not passive; it's patient.

    ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not angry about the door. Something else is going on.‚Äù

    üì¢ Command
    You impose your will.
    You take control, give orders, raise your voice, or simply radiate certainty. Command wins when others hesitate or defer‚Äîbut fails fast if you misread the room.

    ‚ÄúStand down. We have clearance and no time to waste.‚Äù

    üß† Convince
    You reason.
    You use logic, law, precedent, cause and effect. Convince appeals to minds, not hearts. It lands best when emotions are quiet and outcomes matter more than identity.

    ‚ÄúThink about it‚Äîif we meant harm, we wouldn‚Äôt be here talking.‚Äù

    üåÄ Follow
    You yield‚Äîstrategically.
    You echo, defer, or step aside to lower the stakes. It‚Äôs not submission; it‚Äôs redirection. Follow works when confrontation would escalate or confuse. It can reflect back power‚Äîor erase it.

    ‚ÄúSure. Lead the way.‚Äù

    Choosing and Responding
    Players declare their stance first, aloud or silently. NPCs choose after, based on what they observe. This lets players set the emotional frame, then see how the world responds.

    Each stance changes the Target Value of your roll depending on how it clashes or flows with others. You won‚Äôt always know what will work‚Äîbut you‚Äôll always learn something from trying.

    This is the heart of Socio-: your character‚Äôs voice has weight.

That's it, you and your players now know how to play the game. If you would like to know more about the authority figure that approached, read the next section, otherwise you can use the character as your own hook into your own story.

If you need help, the entire rules of the game are online free on GitHub. There is also a discussion forum there and Discord link.

    Ra gestures you forward. ‚ÄòCome with me‚Äîthey‚Äôre waiting.‚Äô You don‚Äôt know who they are.

    Follow Ra and find out what‚Äôs going on.

    Stall or question him‚Äîtry to get information.

    Try to slip away into the crowd unnoticed.

    Insist you‚Äôre leaving, locked door or not. 
    
    Something even more clever?

### Key NPCs

## Ra ‚Äì The Guard at the Gate

**Name:** Ra (nickname; real name hidden)  
**Role:** Authority figure sent to fetch the players  
**Disposition:** Earnest but underinformed  
**Default Stance:** **Command** (especially when confused)  
**Hidden Detail:** He locked the door himself and carries the key  
**Reason:** He needed to relieve himself and didn‚Äôt want anyone leaving before he returned

---

### üí¨ Ra's Opening Line

> ‚ÄúHey! Stop that! What are you doing?‚Äù

If players engage:

> ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Ra. At least, that‚Äôs what folks call me. I‚Äôm supposed to bring you to someone... somewhere... for something.‚Äù

---

### üé≠ NPC Notes for Ra

- Believes he‚Äôs in charge, but doesn‚Äôt fully understand the situation.  
- Trying to sound official but missing a lot of details.  
- Didn‚Äôt think to ask who the players are, where they‚Äôre from, or why they‚Äôre here. He‚Äôs just following instructions.

---

### üé≤ Stance Dynamics

Ra begins in **Command stance**, regardless of what the players say. He‚Äôs not angry‚Äîjust doing his job with borrowed confidence.

He remains in Command unless influenced by:
- **Sympathy** ‚Üí He becomes apologetic or helpful.
- **Insight** ‚Üí He reveals what he knows (or doesn‚Äôt).
- **Follow** ‚Üí He reconsiders his own stance and may defer.
- **Convince** ‚Üí He can be persuaded with clarity.
- **Repeated pressure (~7 hard pushes)** ‚Üí He panics, calls for backup, and shifts the scene toward group tension (but not violence unless escalated heavily).

If asked directly about the door:

> ‚ÄúOh, that? I locked it. Had to take a leak. Didn‚Äôt want y‚Äôall disappearing before I got back.‚Äù

---

### üß≠ Narrator Tips for Playing Ra

- **Don‚Äôt play him as a fool.** He‚Äôs earnest, not incompetent‚Äîjust uninformed and slightly overwhelmed.
- **Let the players shape the tone.** If they‚Äôre kind, let Ra be helpful. If they‚Äôre pushy, let him stiffen. If they‚Äôre clever, let him fumble forward into cooperation.
- **Hold his real name back.** Only offer it after a successful **Sympathy** or **Insight** check‚Äîor if someone shows genuine care for who he *is* rather than what he *does*.

> Ra is a test of the stance system. He rewards emotional intelligence more than mechanical force.

***---***

#### Kessa ‚Äì The Everything Merchant

**Name:** Kessa  
**Role:** Market stall owner with far too much for sale  
**Disposition:** Friendly surface, guarded core  
**Default Stance:** **Insight** (gauging who she's dealing with)  
**Emotional Detail (Empathy 6+):** Genuinely curious about new faces, but there's wariness underneath‚Äîsomeone recently tried to cheat her. She's proud of her reputation but worried about making ends meet in this location.

---

### üí¨ Kessa's Opening Line

> ‚ÄúWell now, haven‚Äôt seen your faces before! Name‚Äôs Kessa, and if I don‚Äôt have it, you don‚Äôt need it. What catches your eye?‚Äù

---

### üé≠ NPC Notes for Kessa

- Kessa‚Äôs stall is overflowing: weapons, tools, glittering junk, real gear, odd trinkets. No apparent organizing logic, but she seems to know where everything is.
- She doesn‚Äôt mind haggling, but she does mind disrespect.
- She wants to make sales‚Äîbut not bad ones. She wants customers, not problems.
- Her attention is always partial: she‚Äôs clocking everyone in the courtyard while she speaks.

---

### üé≤ Stance Dynamics

Kessa starts in **Insight stance**, watching players for tells and intentions.

She shifts stance easily if players engage with care or curiosity:
- **Sympathy** ‚Üí Opens up about recent financial trouble or a personal story.
- **Convince** ‚Üí Respects logic; might offer a fair deal or commentary on the item.
- **Command** ‚Üí Closes off or raises prices slightly (‚ÄúOh, that tone costs extra.‚Äù).
- **Follow** ‚Üí Grows suspicious if too deferential; tests to see if it‚Äôs a trick.
- **Insight** ‚Üí She enjoys being mirrored, may share rare or useful goods.

> If the players try to steal, cheat, or deceive her and fail, she will escalate to draw public attention‚Äînot violence, but sharp words and loud accusations.

---

### üß≠ Narrator Tips for Playing Kessa

- **Let her breathe.** She doesn‚Äôt rush to conclusions. She wants to know who you are before she opens up.
- **Reward charm, creativity, or genuine curiosity.** She has gear others don‚Äôt.
- **Let her be petty if insulted‚Äîbut not cruel.** Kessa has learned to survive, and she respects survivors.
- **Let her have connections.** She might drop a hint about Ra (‚ÄúYou mean the guard that locked the courtyard? He was in a hurry‚Ä¶‚Äù), or foreshadow the next act.

> Kessa is a flexible roleplay hub. She can introduce economy, backstory, relationships, or unexpected help‚Äîdepending on how the players treat her.

#### The Crowd
Approximately 30-40 other people mill about the marketplace - other travelers, local merchants, city guards, and townspeople. Treat them as a single social entity during crowd scenes, but individual merchants can be addressed separately.

## The Crowd ‚Äì A Living Backdrop

The courtyard is busy‚Äî30 to 40 people, mostly merchants and customers. They move, shout, haggle, eat, glance sideways. They are not meant to be full characters, but they are not scenery either. The crowd is the sound of a peopled world.

---

### üé≠ What Is the Crowd?

The crowd is a **fragmented collective**, a tangle of travelers, locals, workers, and opportunists. It has no single voice, but it responds to what it sees. It notices stance, status, volume, and tension.

It is mostly **background noise**, but players or narrators may bring it into focus when needed‚Äîeither to test social play, escalate stakes, or reflect character presence.

---

### üé≤ Crowd Reaction Mechanics

The crowd does not roll dice, but it **reacts to social exertion**. Use the following guidance:

- If a **player uses Command** and their opponent counters with **Insight** or **Convince**, the crowd sees the player as weak or flailing.  
- If a **player uses Command** and their opponent **Follows**, the crowd may cheer, nod, or give space‚Äî‚ÄúAh, they‚Äôre the one in charge.‚Äù
- If a **Sympathy** move lands, the crowd may soften, murmur agreement, or join in.
- If a **Deceive** play fails, the crowd may heckle, whisper, or escalate suspicion.
- If no one asserts a clear frame, the crowd remains **unmoved**‚Äîa passive murmur behind the scene.

> The crowd is a **social mirror**. It reflects tone. It follows strength. It resists mixed signals.

---

### üß† Mood Tags (Optional)

If the narrator wants a crowd ‚Äúfeel,‚Äù pick one or two of the following and let them color the background:

- `Restless`
- `Curious`
- `Bored`
- `Nervous`
- `Divided`
- `Irritated`
- `Hopeful`
- `Suspicious`
- `Hungry`
- `Distracted`

These don‚Äôt require tracking‚Äîjust flavor the way people react to the players and events. A `Suspicious` crowd might fall silent when Ra arrives. A `Restless` crowd might erupt at the first shout.

---

### üé≠ When Players Address the Crowd

Players can speak to the crowd directly. This is an invitation to take center stage. Handle it like a normal social action‚Äîwith stance declared, and a TV chosen based on the mood and message.

- A compelling speech (TV 3)
- Rousing authority (TV 4)
- Complex persuasion across factions (TV 5+)

Success changes the tone of the whole marketplace. Failure might spread gossip, draw a rival‚Äôs attention, or cost the player face.

> **Players who address the crowd are playing with momentum.** Done well, it opens doors. Done poorly, it echoes behind them.

---

### üß≠ Narrator Tips for the Crowd

- **Use it sparingly.** The crowd is not there to be managed‚Äîit‚Äôs there to reflect.
- **Give it a voice when things are tense.** Murmurs. Cheers. Silence. The crowd doesn‚Äôt need words to shape the scene.
- **Let it fade back down.** After the moment passes, let the crowd go back to being noise‚Äîuntil someone pulls them back in.

---

### Economics: The Gold Standard

Characters can purchase any item at or below their Generational Wealth level during the courtyard phase. Items cost their listed gold value - your daily wealth represents what you can reasonably access without affecting your standard of living.

Economics are not inherently easy. They are complex and complicated mechanisms for distributing goods and services. Below are supplemental rules for narrators that want to bother with such rules. The rules above are simple and there is no reason not to leave it the only rule established in the gold standard for now.

**Haggler Technique**: If you want to haggle with a merchant, you can purchase items above your wealth level by paying **Base Cost + (Your Daily Wealth √ó Gold Difference between your wealth and the item's wealth)**. This represents major savings, windfalls, or going into debt for essential equipment.

### Running Social Encounters with NPCs

**Social stances work like tactical positioning - NPCs declare last after seeing player approaches.** When players use Convince (logic), respond with Sympathy (emotion) to counter, or Command (authority) to redirect. NPCs should have clear motivations that drive their stance choices. **Helper cards activate before the main social roll - the helper must succeed first, then their bonus applies to the primary actor.** Failed helpers often make NPCs more suspicious or defensive, increasing difficulty instead of helping. **Keep Target Values around 8-12 for normal social challenges, add +1-3 for each additional helper due to coordination complexity.** NPCs can change stances between rounds as conversations evolve. Let the dice and player creativity drive outcomes; critical successes might create lasting positive relationships, while critical failures create reputation effects or social complications.

# GM Advice: Edge Cases & Interpretations

For complete skill descriptions, helper card mechanics, and character advancement rules, see the free open-source Socio- Core Rules available on GitHub at [link]. This starter module covers the essential mechanics to begin play.

## Can Characters Grant Helper Cards to NPCs?

**Situation**: Maria (Support archetype, Teaching d10) wants to coordinate untrained civilians to provide specific assistance during medical emergency.

**Rules Analysis**:
- **Teaching skill** explicitly allows "granting temporary access to helper actions"
- **Support archetype** specializes in "team coordination" and "empowering others"
- **No explicit restriction** against teaching helpers to NPCs
- **Community Link helper card** specifically calls in NPC assistance

**Ruling**: **YES, with limitations**

### Requirements:
1. **Character must have Teaching skill** (d6+ recommended)
2. **Must have time to give instructions** (Minor Action minimum)
3. **NPCs must be willing and capable** (basic intelligence, not panicked)
4. **Helper effects reduced by one tier** when used by untrained NPCs
5. **Coordination Complexity increases by +2** due to managing untrained helpers

### Examples:
- **Field Medic**: Maria can teach bystander to apply pressure to wound
- **Safe Space**: Maria can guide friend to provide emotional support
- **Community Link**: Maria naturally activates existing networks

### GM Guidelines:
- **Teaching roll required first** - failure means NPCs can't execute properly
- **Limited to helpers that make narrative sense** - can't teach "Flanking" to civilians
- **One-time use unless character invests time in proper training**
- **Should feel empowering, not game-breaking**

---

## Action Scale Mixing During Emergencies

**Situation**: Character needs to handle immediate crisis (Instant) while also coordinating long-term response (Short/Long).

**Ruling**: **Characters can attempt mixed scales with penalties**
- **Primary action** uses normal rules
- **Secondary actions** take +3 TV penalty for divided attention
- **Coordination complexity increases** for each additional time scale

---

## Modern Setting Technology

**Situation**: Helper cards that reference medieval concepts in modern settings.

**Ruling**: **Translate thematically, keep mechanics**
- **"Ritual Circle"** becomes **"Support Group"**
- **"Command Relay"** works with radios, phones, or gesture
- **"Flanking"** works in any tactical situation

---

## NPC Skill Levels for Helper Distribution

**Untrained Civilian**: d4 maximum for any taught helper
**Trained Professional**: d6 maximum, d8 if in their expertise area
**Fellow Expert**: Full helper effect if they have related skills

---

## Community Building vs Individual Heroics

**Design Intent**: Support archetype should coordinate others rather than solve everything alone. When in doubt, ask "Is this empowering others or just showing off character abilities?"

**Good Support Play**: Teaching, coordinating, enabling
**Problematic Support Play**: Being sole solution provider

---

## Status Effect Applications in Crisis

**High-stress situations** can apply status effects to bystanders:
- **Afraid**: Reduces effectiveness of taught helpers
- **Inspired**: NPCs can exceed normal limitations
- **Panicked**: NPCs cannot learn new helpers until calmed

## Notes
**Background**: Daughter of skilled furniture maker (father) and small market vendor (mother). Parents immigrated from India, built stable middle-class life. Discovered parkour at 14, became local prodigy. Started posting videos at 16, went viral at 18, now has 2.3M followers across platforms.

**Phone Addiction**: Checks notifications every 30 seconds, needs constant validation from likes/comments. Physically uncomfortable when phone battery dies. Makes decisions based on "will this get engagement?" rather than personal safety or relationships.

**Rival Drama**: Competitors claim she either uses hidden safety equipment (faking danger) or that her "impressive" stunts are actually basic moves made to look difficult through camera angles. She's particularly targeted by Marcus Kim (@UrbanPhantom) who has 3.8M followers and calls her "suburban parkour princess."

**Content Style**: Combines genuine athletic skill with strategic camera work. Not fake, but optimized for visual impact. Constantly seeking more impressive locations and stunts to maintain audience growth.

**Personality**: Outwardly confident, internally validation-dependent. Genuinely skilled but struggles with self-worth beyond social metrics. Loyal to fans but competitive with peers. Living entirely in the present moment of content creation.

**Current Situation**: Facing pressure to attempt increasingly dangerous stunts as algorithm changes reduce her reach. Considering collaboration with more extreme creators but worried about maintaining her "accessible athlete" brand.

**Blind Spots**: Assumes everyone can prioritize treatment like he did. Doesn't understand choosing between rent and therapy, frustrated when clients don't follow suggestions that require money. Genuinely caring but lacks class consciousness.

**Recovery Philosophy**: Strong 12-step believer. Sees addiction as primarily spiritual/personal issue, doesn't grasp systemic factors. Excellent sponsor for professionals, struggles with clients facing poverty.

**Personality**: Well-meaning but privileged. Escaped poverty through business success and thinks others just need proper motivation. Working with kids is slowly teaching him that circumstances matter more than he realized.
