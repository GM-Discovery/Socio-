## 🎮 How to Play

🎲 **Roll skill dice** (starting at d4, rising with training)  
📈 **Compare to a Target Value (TV)** — success or failure moves the story  
🧭 **Declare your Social Stance** when entering dialogue — your emotional posture sets the tone:

| Stance | Purpose | Emoji |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 🌿 Sympathy | Connection & resonance | Emotional appeal |
| 🔎 Insight | Observation & pattern reading | Detective mode |
| 📢 Command | Asserting authority | Direct leadership |
| 🧠 Convince | Logical persuasion | Reason & facts |
| 🌀 Follow | Strategic deference | Diffusion & redirection |

These stances affect outcomes dynamically. The world reacts to your tone, not just your words.
