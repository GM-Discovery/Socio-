# 📖 PART I: THE LOCKED COURTYARD
*Learn the Game Through Story*

---

## 📖 Book Blurb (Read First)

**🎭 Welcome to Socio-: Stories of Us.**

You are locked in a courtyard. That much is certain.

But everything else—why you're here, who you are, and what lies beyond the heavy door—is yours to discover.

This is not a test of combat. It is a test of character.

Let the story begin.

---

## 🎯 Scenario Hook

Gather your friends, get ready to tell a story together. 

Pick a Narrator. Players are helping tell a story by controlling characters in the narrator's story. Pass this document to the Narrator. Give the narrator some time to read the instructions (5-15 minutes or so)

### 🎬 Narrator Instructions

> Read these kinds of sections in this format aloud to the players when you're ready for it.

**Don't read these instructions to players.** This module is written for someone that's never played a TTRPG before. It is suggested you read at least the first page through the end of the **🚪 What's Beyond the Door** section before running the game.

---

## 🌅 Opening: Setting the Scene

After you're ready, begin below.

**📢 Read this to your players:**

> Your characters are locked in a courtyard. We start there. Everyone is trying to leave at the same time and will find out the door is locked. Before we do that, you must figure out your character. I will now pass out character sheets. Your character can do whatever you would like to do in this courtyard. You can meet the other players' characters in the crowd, practice your skills, purchase equipment that is available, or otherwise prepare for the challenge of the locked door.

**🎯 Narrator Decision Point:** You must now decide how you want to play the game. Players can take the characters presented at the end of this scenario and pass out pre-generated character sheets. Or you can read the core rules Chapters 1 and 2 to have players make their own characters. Once you have completed character selection, you should continue to **🛍️ The Courtyard Marketplace** to help give equipment to the characters.

> **🎓 Teaching Note:** This scene teaches gameplay one layer at a time: exploration, shopping, social interaction, skill rolls, and confrontation.

You don't need to explain everything upfront—just let them try things. This courtyard is your practice arena.

---

## 🛍️ The Courtyard Marketplace

**📢 Read to players:**

> "The ancient stone courtyard stretches before you, enclosed by high walls. Market stalls fill the space creating a maze of commerce and conversation. The air smells of roasted meat and the sharp tang of metalwork. Merchants call their wares while customers haggle.
>
> The only exit is a massive ironbound oak door, currently standing open, through which you all entered via a long causeway. People in authority lean against the walls, keeping a casual eye on the crowds."

**🔍 For players with Empathy 6+:** The general mood is relaxed but slightly anxious - merchants are eager to make sales before the day ends, and travelers seem hurried to complete their business.

**⚠️ Narrator Note - Metagaming:** Metagaming means using information your character wouldn't have to make decisions. If you tell one player something their character knows, other players shouldn't act on that information unless their characters learn it naturally through conversation or observation. It is strongly urged not to metagame, including sharing the numerical values of your character unless prompted.

## 🧭 Navigation Guide

- **🛒 If veteran players want to browse and purchase equipment before investigating the door:** Go to section **💰 Equipment and Economics**
- **👥 If players want to interact with NPCs:** Kessa and Ra are available.
- **🎲 If players want to practice skills or test mechanics:** Let them experiment freely
- **🚪 When ALL players are ready to check the door:** Go to **🚪 What's Behind the Door**

---

### 🛍️ Kessa – The Everything Merchant

**👤 Name:** Kessa  
**🎭 Role:** Market stall owner with far too much for sale  
**😊 Disposition:** Friendly surface, guarded core  
**🔎 Default Stance:** **Insight** (gauging who she's dealing with)  
**💭 Emotional Detail (Empathy 6+):** Genuinely curious about new faces, but there's wariness underneath—someone recently tried to cheat her. She's proud of her reputation but worried about making ends meet in this location.

---

### 💬 Kessa's Opening Line

> *"Well now, haven't seen your faces before! Name's Kessa, and if I don't have it, you don't need it. What catches your eye?"*

---

### 🎭 NPC Notes for Kessa

- Kessa's stall is overflowing: weapons, tools, glittering junk, real gear, odd trinkets. No apparent organizing logic, but she seems to know where everything is.
- She doesn't mind haggling, but she does mind disrespect.
- She wants to make sales—but not bad ones. She wants customers, not problems.
- Her attention is always partial: she's clocking everyone in the courtyard while she speaks.

---

### 🎲 Stance Dynamics

**🔎 Kessa starts in Insight stance**, watching players for tells and intentions.

She shifts stance easily if players engage with care or curiosity:
- **🌿 Sympathy** → Opens up about recent financial trouble or a personal story.
- **🧠 Convince** → Respects logic; might offer a fair deal or commentary on the item.
- **📢 Command** → Closes off or raises prices slightly (*"Oh, that tone costs extra."*).
- **🌀 Follow** → Grows suspicious if too deferential; tests to see if it's a trick.
- **🔎 Insight** → She enjoys being mirrored, may share rare or useful goods.

> **⚠️ If the players try to steal, cheat, or deceive her and fail**, she will escalate to draw public attention—not violence, but sharp words and loud accusations.

---

### 🧭 Narrator Tips for Playing Kessa

- **🌬️ Let her breathe.** She doesn't rush to conclusions. She wants to know who you are before she opens up.
- **🏆 Reward charm, creativity, or genuine curiosity.** She has gear others don't.
- **😤 Let her be petty if insulted—but not cruel.** Kessa has learned to survive, and she respects survivors.
- **🔗 Let her have connections.** She might drop a hint about Ra (*"You mean the guard that locked the courtyard? He was in a hurry…"*), or foreshadow the next act.

> **💡 Kessa is a flexible roleplay hub.** She can introduce economy, backstory, relationships, or unexpected help—depending on how the players treat her.

---

### 👥 The Crowd – A Living Backdrop

The courtyard is busy—30 to 40 people, mostly merchants and customers. They move, shout, haggle, eat, glance sideways. They are not meant to be full characters, but they are not scenery either. **The crowd is the sound of a peopled world.**

---

### 🎭 What Is the Crowd?

The crowd is a **fragmented collective**, a tangle of travelers, locals, workers, and opportunists. It has no single voice, but it responds to what it sees. It notices stance, status, volume, and tension.

It is mostly **background noise**, but players or narrators may bring it into focus when needed—either to test social play, escalate stakes, or reflect character presence.

---

### 🎲 Crowd Reaction Mechanics

**The crowd does not roll dice**, but it **reacts to social exertion**. Use the following guidance:

- If a **player uses Command** and their opponent counters with **Insight** or **Convince**, the crowd sees the player as weak or flailing.  
- If a **player uses Command** and their opponent **Follows**, the crowd may cheer, nod, or give space—*"Ah, they're the one in charge."*
- If a **Sympathy** move lands, the crowd may soften, murmur agreement, or join in.
- If a **Deceive** play fails, the crowd may heckle, whisper, or escalate suspicion.
- If no one asserts a clear frame, the crowd remains **unmoved**—a passive murmur behind the scene.

> **🪞 The crowd is a social mirror.** It reflects tone. It follows strength. It resists mixed signals.

---

## 🚪 What's Behind the Door

When you're ready to proceed with the story:

**📢 Read to players:**

> "The oak door is heavy, reinforced with black iron bands. There's no visible lock on this side."
>
> "If you want to try to push it, tell me how hard your character tries—just casually pushing, shoving with your whole body, or doing something clever. Then we'll roll to see if you succeed."

---

## ⚙️ CORE MECHANIC

> **🎲 To attempt something uncertain, roll your skill die.** If the result meets or exceeds the Target Value (TV), you succeed. If not, you fail—but failure is part of the story.
>
> **📊 Characters start with a d4 skill in every skill.** If they were trained in a skill through character creation, they have a d6 in the skill, which means their odds of success are higher.

| **TV** | **Difficulty** | **Approx. Odds** | **Notes** |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Trivial | No roll | Succeeds automatically |
| 2 | Easy | ~75% | Most trained characters succeed |
| 3 | Moderate | ~50% | Even odds |
| 4 | Hard | ~25% | Most characters fail without help |
| 5+ | Nearly Impossible | ~<10% | Requires narrative brilliance or luck |

**📈 Rolls are primarily based on the skill die, not the attribute.** Attributes only enter the math if explicitly called for—typically through a specific card effect, helper rule, or derived mechanic.

**🚫 Players should fail on their first attempts** at opening the door unless doing something extraordinaire. If they succeed, have them interrupted before getting the door fully open, or if they fail, then read the following.

**📢 Read to players:**

> "One of the local authority figures has walked past and seen you at the door. They call out from a distance at you as they start approaching directly and quickly, "Hey, stop that! What are you doing?" The figure is using the "Command" Stance.

---

## 🎭 Social Conflict: Understanding Stances

> **⚔️ The figure approaching you has taken a Command stance**—assertive, authoritative, expecting compliance. In Socio-, when stakes are high and words matter, every participant chooses a Social Stance before speaking or acting.
>
> **🎯 Your stance is how you enter the space between you and the other.** There are five.

### 🌿 **Sympathy**
*You offer connection.*

You seek resonance—emotional, relational, or cultural. Sympathy is not weakness; it's risk. To use it well, you must mean it, or fake it well enough to matter. Works best when others are rigid or disconnected.

*"I get it. I've been there. That's not what we want, is it?"*

### 🔎 **Insight**
*You observe.*

You're watching more than speaking—trying to understand what's really happening beneath the surface. Insight works on patterns, silences, tells. It's not passive; it's patient.

*"You're not angry about the door. Something else is going on."*

### 📢 **Command**
*You impose your will.*

You take control, give orders, raise your voice, or simply radiate certainty. Command wins when others hesitate or defer—but fails fast if you misread the room.

*"Stand down. We have clearance and no time to waste."*

### 🧠 **Convince**
*You reason.*

You use logic, law, precedent, cause and effect. Convince appeals to minds, not hearts. It lands best when emotions are quiet and outcomes matter more than identity.

*"Think about it—if we meant harm, we wouldn't be here talking."*

### 🌀 **Follow**
*You yield—strategically.*

You echo, defer, or step aside to lower the stakes. It's not submission; it's redirection. Follow works when confrontation would escalate or confuse. It can reflect back power—or erase it.

*"Sure. Lead the way."*

---

### 🎯 Choosing and Responding

**🎪 Players declare their stance first**, aloud or silently. NPCs choose after, based on what they observe. This lets players set the emotional frame, then see how the world responds.

Each stance changes the Target Value of your roll depending on how it clashes or flows with others. You won't always know what will work—but you'll always learn something from trying.

**💫 This is the heart of Socio-: your character's voice has weight.**

---

## 🛡️ Ra – The Guard at the Gate

**👤 Name:** Ra (nickname; real name hidden)  
**🎭 Role:** Authority figure sent to fetch the players  
**😊 Disposition:** Earnest but underinformed  
**📢 Default Stance:** **Command** (especially when confused)  
**🔒 Hidden Detail:** He locked the door himself and carries the key  
**🤷 Reason:** He needed to relieve himself and didn't want anyone leaving before he returned

---

### 💬 Ra's Opening Line

> *"Hey! Stop that! What are you doing?"*

**If players engage:**

> *"Name's Ra. At least, that's what folks call me. I'm supposed to bring you to someone... somewhere... for something."*

---

### 🎭 NPC Notes for Ra

- Believes he's in charge, but doesn't fully understand the situation.  
- Trying to sound official but missing a lot of details.  
- Didn't think to ask who the players are, where they're from, or why they're here. He's just following instructions.

---

### 🎲 Stance Dynamics

**📢 Ra begins in Command stance**, regardless of what the players say. He's not angry—just doing his job with borrowed confidence.

He remains in Command unless influenced by:
- **🌿 Sympathy** → He becomes apologetic or helpful.
- **🔎 Insight** → He reveals what he knows (or doesn't).
- **🌀 Follow** → He reconsiders his own stance and may defer.
- **🧠 Convince** → He can be persuaded with clarity.
- **⚠️ Repeated pressure (~7 hard pushes)** → He panics, calls for backup, and shifts the scene toward group tension (but not violence unless escalated heavily).

**If asked directly about the door:**

> *"Oh, that? I locked it. Had to take a leak. Didn't want y'all disappearing before I got back."*

---

**🎉 That's it, you and your players now know how to play the game.** When the players are ready to learn what Ra's instructions really are, and what lies beyond that door, read on...

**📢 Read to players:**

> Ra scratches his head and looks at the group more carefully. "Right, well... I'm supposed to tell you about this opportunity. There's these Games trainers here in town, and they've got this bet going. Something about proving yourselves worthy of the Games—you know, the big competition that happens every ten winters? Next one's still a few years off, but..."
>
> He pulls out a crumpled piece of paper and squints at it.
>
> "Says here you're supposed to... 'Return with the crown of a named king from the fractured Turtle continent.' Sounds mad to me, but what do I know? They say if you pull it off, you get a featured spot in the Games when they come around. Prize money, fame, all that."
>
> Ra looks up from the paper. "Beyond this door? That's the start of the road to the shipping docks. From there, you can get passage to anywhere in the known world. Including..." He glances at the paper again. "...the Turtle continent, apparently."
>
> "So, uh... you interested? Because if not, I'm supposed to unlock this door and let you go about your business."

# 🌍 PART II: WELCOME TO NIAVA
*The World Beyond the Door*

---

## 🌟 Beyond the Door Lies Niava...

The door Ra guards is not just an exit from a courtyard—it is a threshold between the familiar and the vast. Beyond it lies Niava, a world of three known continents where the greatest human experiment in generations is unfolding.

To understand this world, you must first understand the people who are reshaping it.

---

## 🕯️ The Society Beyond the Mists: Rituals of Identity and Being

There are many ways to understand a person or a people. To understand Kai's people, the Society Beyond the Mists, you need to understand their deepest rituals.

Beyond the Mists, identity is not assumed, it is summoned. When a child reaches age, they sit before the Echoing Stones. The Stones do not speak, but they reflect. What is heard is not sound—but the voice that shaped the soul. They listen for the voices of their ancestors and parents, friends, tribe, and self.

These rituals are not mere tradition—they are the living mythology being translated into reality through the experimental **Bread Standard** society now taking root on a small island in the Turtle continent.

---

These pages were compiled by Kai, who walked Beyond the Mists, and left these rituals for those who might follow.

### 🕯️ Ritual of the Silent Audience

**Life Stage:** Adolescence (typically between ages 11–14)

#### Lore  
> *In the Society Beyond the Mists, every child nearing adulthood must face the silence. They are brought before the elders—not to be judged, but to be heard. The audience is sworn to silence: no gesture, no question, no interruption. In this sacred space, the speaker sees themself most clearly—by listening to what they are brave enough to say.*

This important ritual marks the passage of a child into an adult. Children as young as 10 can attempt it and most will try before 15.

#### 📜 Ritual Prompt  
> **When given space to be, what do you become?**  
> *To begin this ritual, consider yourself in front of an audience sworn to quiet and polite listening. What would you say, knowing you will be heard but not answered?*

#### 🎭 Player Instructions

You may deliver your statement aloud, write it as a monologue, or perform it in character through a conversation with another PC or the GM-as-witness.

Your statement must be **authentic** to your character—not what they want others to hear, but what they would say if they believed no one would stop them, shame them, or interrupt them.

This is not confession. It is **unfiltered presence**.

#### 🎲 Optional Skill Challenge

- **On Success (TV 3+)**: Your words strike true. Something essential is revealed.
- **On Critical Success (TV 5)**: You gain clarity even you did not expect. Choose one:
  - `Inspired (Status)` – for the next two scenes
  - `Clarity Tag` – gain insight into one PC, NPC, or faction motive
  - Unlock a `Mirror Slot` on your sheet (for future story reflection)
- **On Failure**: Your words fall short. You cannot find your voice.
  - Apply the `Stifled (Status)` – Disadvantage to social rolls until a peer or elder reflects your unspoken truth back to you
  - Mark a `Hidden Mirror` – this truth remains buried, awaiting another chance

#### 🏷️ Ritual Tags and Legacy Outcomes

- `Audience Witnessed` – Your words were recorded by an elder or PC. You may call on them once per arc to **confirm your truth** or **remind you who you are**.

#### 🧭 Narrative Hooks

- The silent audience may return later as witnesses in a trial, negotiation, or moment of crisis—drawing on what they heard.
- An NPC may have been in the audience with a hidden connection to your words.

---

### 🔤 Ritual of the Earned Name

**Life Stage:** Infancy → Completion by Young Adulthood

#### Lore  
> *In the Society Beyond the Mists, a child is not born with a name—they are loaned one. A name is not a possession, but a promise. Until it is earned, it is hollow. Some grow into their given name. Some forge a new one. But all must chase it, as a shadow just out of reach.*

#### 📜 Ritual Prompt  
> **What would your name be if you had to earn it?**

To begin this ritual, choose:
- Will you attempt to **fulfill the name given to you**?
- Or will you attempt to **claim a new name** that reflects the person you believe you are becoming?

Then define—quietly or aloud—**what must be done to earn it**. This can be a vow, a trial, a reconciliation, or a symbolic act known only to you.

#### 🎭 Player Instructions

Declare the **Name in Question** and the **Task to Prove It**. This task must be narratively and emotionally significant.

You may complete the task through roleplay, confrontation, service, or sacrifice. You may ask the GM to hold you accountable by introducing tests related to the task throughout the story.

#### 🎲 Optional Skill Challenge

Roll `Lore: Legacy` or `Resolve: Vow` once the task is near completion.  
- **On Success**: You earn your name. Choose one:
  - Gain the `True Name` tag – may be invoked once per arc for strength of will or social standing
  - You may now use your earned name in formal rituals and unlock its narrative powers
- **On Failure**: The name rejects you—for now.
  - You bear the `Nameless` tag until you attempt a new task or reconcile with the first
  - If others learn of your failure, you may be challenged or dismissed socially by certain NPCs

#### 🏷️ Ritual Tags and Legacy Outcomes

- `True Name` – This name may be inscribed on sacred documents, invoked in debates, or grant you advantage when invoking family or cultural memory
- `Nameless` – Characters may hesitate to trust, follow, or honor you. May impact interactions with the Society Beyond the Mists
- `Name Given, Name Forged` – If you switch your chosen name path mid-story, you gain this tag and draw the attention of fate (GM determines one major shift or omen)

#### 🧭 Narrative Hooks

- Your earned name may become part of a prophecy, inheritance, or political claim
- Elders or enemies may dispute your right to the name
- Someone else may be chasing *your* name—or bear a name you were denied

---

### 🍽️ Ritual of the Shared Meal

**Life Stage:** Any  
**Context:** When hosting a new stranger in your home, table, or camp

#### Lore
> *To feed a stranger is to tell them: "I am not afraid of you." To share your own plate is to say, "You are welcome to know me." In the Society Beyond the Mists, a newcomer is not interrogated, but nourished—and then invited to listen. A host must not speak of another until they have offered something of their own. A guest must not speak until they have been fed. When all are full, stories begin.*

#### 📜 Ritual Prompt
You arrive, or welcome, as a stranger.  
The table is prepared.  
The guest's plate is empty.  
Each host offers food from their own, and says:

- Their name
- One thing about themselves they'd like to be asked about

The guest eats, then—when ready—asks the hosts in return.

#### 🎭 Player Instructions

**If you are the host:**
- When a new PC, NPC, or visitor arrives at your shared space, begin the ritual
- Each host offers from their own meal to the guest's plate (can be symbolic)
- Each host gives:
  - Their name
  - A topic, trait, or truth about themselves they want the guest to ask about later

**If you are the guest:**
- You may not speak until all hosts have spoken and given
- You are expected—if willing—to ask about each host's offering before departing

#### 🎲 Optional Skill Challenge

Roll Social Grace, Hospitality, or Empathy: Inclusion (host) or Memory, Curiosity, or Networking (guest) at the end of the meal.

- **On Success (TV 3+)**: The interaction builds meaningful connection.
  - Hosts gain `Trusted Host` (Advantage on future interactions with guest)
  - Guest gains `Well Received` (Advantage on asking favors or insights from hosts)
- **On Critical Success (TV 5+)**: A deeper understanding blooms.
  - Hosts gain `Story Echoed` – Guest may share or reveal something significant
  - Guest gains `Shared Hearth` – gain an Anchor or Safe Zone tag in this place
- **On Failure**: A misunderstanding lingers.
  - Apply `Mismatched (Status)` – Disadvantage on social rolls with this group until conflict is addressed
  - GM may introduce subtle tension or awkwardness as a story beat

#### 🏷️ Ritual Tags and Legacy Outcomes

| Tag / Status | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| `Trusted Host` | Hosts gain Advantage on social rolls with the guest |
| `Well Received` | Guest may request small favors or information without suspicion |
| `Story Echoed` | One host receives a meaningful truth from the guest (GM discretion) |
| `Shared Hearth` | This location becomes an Anchor point or Safe Zone for the guest |
| `Mismatched (Status)` | Disadvantage on social rolls with this group until reconciled |

#### 🧭 Narrative Hooks

- A guest may pretend to forget what they were told—and must rebuild trust
- A host might hide their real truth behind a misleading "thing"
- The meal may be interrupted, and the ritual must be resumed or completed later
- Over time, hosts may tell if a guest has honored the tradition—or only consumed

---

### ⏳ Ritual of the Last Hour

**Life Stage:** Any (Performed annually, usually near one's birthdate)

#### Lore
> *In the Society Beyond the Mists, each year, near the anniversary of their birth, one is expected to prepare as though they might not see another. This is not morbid—it is sacred. The "Last Hour" is shared with another: a declaration of unfinished business, an entrusting of words that may outlive the speaker. Whether friend, rival, sibling, or stranger, the listener becomes a vessel of memory. In this way, the people Beyond the Mists rehearse both dying and being remembered.*

#### 📜 Ritual Prompt
> **If this were your last hour, what must be said—and to whom?**  
> Choose someone to hear you. Offer them your words, your regrets, your requests. Let your story ripple beyond your own breath.

#### 🎭 Player Instructions

To begin:
- Pay 2 Favor Points (may be split: 1 FP each if mutually performed)
- Select a bonded character (PC or significant NPC)
- Speak in character: Share what you would say if this were truly your last chance to speak with them

The listener must remain silent until the speaker concludes. Afterward, they may respond, but are bound by social norm to treat the speaker's words with reverence and seriousness.

This is not a dramatic goodbye—it is a solemn truth.

#### 🎲 Optional Skill Challenge

Roll Resolve: Legacy or Empathy: Truth at the conclusion of your farewell.

- **On Success (TV 3+)**: The moment lands meaningfully. Choose one:
  - `Echo Promise` – the listener may fulfill one request posthumously (if death occurs), or draw strength from your words once per arc
  - `Memory Carved` – gain a +1 on legacy-related rolls involving this character or topic for the rest of the campaign
- **On Critical Success (TV 5+)**: Your Last Hour echoes even louder.
  - Gain the tag `Legacy Entrusted` – should you die, your story continues through the bonded character's choices, who gains narrative license to act on your behalf (GM adjudicates the scope)
- **On Failure**: Your words falter or feel hollow.
  - Apply `Unfinished (Status)` – you gain Disadvantage on Willpower or morale rolls until you find peace or retry the ritual
  - Listener may choose to reject the bond, breaking a Favor link between you

#### 🏷️ Ritual Tags and Legacy Outcomes

| Tag / Status | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| `Echo Promise` | Listener may complete a request after your death, or gain a once-per-arc inspiration |
| `Memory Carved` | +1 to relevant rolls tied to legacy, relationships, or past actions |
| `Legacy Entrusted` | If you die, GM grants limited narrative authority to the listener |
| `Unfinished (Status)` | Disadvantage on morale/willpower rolls until resolved |

#### 🧭 Narrative Hooks

- The character may die unexpectedly—and their final words now shape the story
- The listener may twist, forget, or fail to honor the Last Hour
- A third party might have overheard or recorded the ritual
- Characters may form annual traditions around this ritual, evolving their tone over the years
- Political actors may leak or weaponize someone's Last Hour confession

### 🕯️ Ritual of the Three Chants

**Life Stage:** Any (often marking love, loss, or lineage)

#### Lore
> *To name, to bless, to conceal. In the lands beyond the mists, love is not spoken in grand gestures—but in repeated devotion. The Three Chants ritual honors another through repetition and firelight. It is performed for the beloved, the unborn, the departed. One chant for who they are, one for what you give, and one for what you dare not say aloud. You chant until the first flame dies, then bear witness as the light fades, one by one.*

#### 📜 Ritual Prompt
> **How many candles will you light?**  
> For each, speak three times:
> - Name them and your love.
> - Bless them with a hope or gift.
> - Whisper the truth you cannot name.
> 
> Then, light the next candle.  
> When the first candle dies, stop lighting.  
> Chant for each flame as it goes out.

#### 🎭 Player Instructions

To perform this ritual:
- Choose a person to honor (PC, DMPC, or deceased/NPC)
- Declare how many candles you will light (1–7 is traditional)
- For each candle lit, state aloud or write:
  - Who they are and why you love them
  - What you want for them (blessing, protection, legacy)
  - A hidden truth (spoken, written, or roleplayed as whispered or implied)

When the first flame goes out, you stop lighting new candles. For each candle extinguished after that, speak one final chant in their name until the last is gone.

This ritual is often performed with others. Each participant may light their own series or take turns on shared candles.

#### 🎲 Optional Skill Challenge

Roll Empathy: Love or Lore: Legacy once all candles have died.

- **On Success (TV 3+)**: You feel peace or clarity. Choose one:
  - `Blessing Entrusted` – the one honored gains a mechanical or narrative benefit (GM discretion)
  - `Love Declared` – gain Advantage on one future roll involving this bond
- **On Critical Success (TV 5+)**: The ritual has unexpected power.

### 🎁 Ritual of the Unopened Box

**Life Stage:** Late Adolescence or Adulthood  
*(Typically performed after age 16; once attempted too early, often regretted)*

#### Lore  
> *Joy, too, must be proven. In the Society Beyond the Mists, joy is not just a feeling—it is a bond, a risk, a gift. This ritual teaches that the truest joys can be trusted, shared, and withheld for a time without being lost. A box, unopened, becomes a promise. A return becomes a blessing.*

#### 📜 Ritual Prompt  
> **To begin this ritual, you must find something that brings you great joy.**  
> Place this object in a box that can be closed completely.  
> Deliver the box to someone you trust, and instruct them:  
> *"Do not open this. Return it to me in one year's time."*

#### 🎭 Player Instructions

You must:
- Describe the **object of joy** you are sealing away.
- Choose a character (PC or NPC) to entrust with the box.
- Roleplay or narrate the exchange—what is said, unsaid, or symbolized.

For the next in-world year, the box remains with the other. At the end of that time (or campaign equivalent), they return it to you—opened or unopened.

#### 🎲 Optional Skill Challenge (at the time of return)

Roll `Empathy: Joy` or `Resolve: Trust`

- **If the box is returned unopened:**
  - **On Success**: You receive the `Kept Joy` tag – once per arc, you may call on this memory to resist despair or rekindle hope.
  - **On Critical Success**: You gain a `Bonded Thread` – your connection to the box-bearer deepens permanently. Gain Advantage on social rolls with them until broken.
  - **On Failure**: You doubted or forgot the joy. The return feels hollow. Apply `Detached (Status)` until joy is renewed another way.

- **If the box is returned opened:**
  - Gain the `Joy Betrayed` tag. You may no longer attempt this ritual again in this campaign.
  - You may confront the one who opened it—or forgive them, transforming the tag into `Joy Released`.

#### 🏷️ Ritual Tags and Legacy Outcomes

- `Kept Joy` – Once per arc, spend this tag to resist despair, grief, or hopelessness
- `Bonded Thread` – Strong social tie to the one who kept the promise
- `Joy Betrayed` – Narrative wound; may affect trust-based rolls and interactions
- `Joy Released` – If forgiveness is given, this becomes a source of peace

#### 🧭 Narrative Hooks

- The box may become an object of temptation for the one holding it—NPC storylines may emerge
- The joy inside may become *symbolically needed* before the year ends—testing the ritual
- The return may coincide with a larger celebration, death, or story climax

### 🕸️ Ritual of Shadow's End

**Life Stage:** Early adulthood or before a major rite of passage (e.g. leadership, parenthood, war)

#### Lore
> *In the lands beyond the mists, no one may lead, protect, or guide others until they have faced the self that stalks behind them. The ritual known as Shadow's End sends the supplicant into darkness—into a cave, a locked room, or a mirrored chamber. There, they must slay their shadow. No one else may enter. The door is sealed until dawn. When they emerge—if they emerge—they are asked not "what happened?" but "how did you do it?" The answer marks their readiness. Or reveals their failure.*

#### 📜 Ritual Prompt
> **Enter alone. Face your shadow. Slay it—or fail trying. Then speak only of the how, never the what.**  
> No one may interrupt the shadow hunt.  
> When you return, your guardians will tell their shadow stories—what they faced, what they failed, what they fled.

#### 🎭 Player Instructions

To perform:
- The player declares intent to undergo the ritual
- The character is placed in a sealed symbolic space (a cave, dark room, or dreamscape)
- The player privately describes or narrates how they attempt to slay their shadow
- This may be a literal fight, a symbolic confrontation, or a surrender
- Upon return, they must answer only one question: "How did you slay your shadow?"
- Even if they failed, they may lie, half-tell, or speak in metaphor
- Guardians or mentors may then share their own shadow-hunt stories in response

#### 🎲 Optional Skill Challenge

Roll Resolve: Self-Will, Lore: Inner Myth, or Willpower while in the cave.

- **On Success (TV 3+)**: You slay the shadow, however you choose to define it.
  - Gain the tag `Shadow-Faced` – you cannot be coerced by illusions or doubts once per arc
- **On Critical Success (TV 5+)**: You befriend, transform, or integrate the shadow.
  - Gain `Shadowbound Ally` – your shadow speaks to you in crisis; once per arc, ask a silent question and gain narrative clarity (GM adjudicates)
- **On Failure**: You emerge, but the shadow is untouched—or worse.
  - Apply the `Haunted (Status)` – recurring visions, inner sabotage, or shaken confidence
  - Optionally gain the tag `False Light` if you lie to your guardians

#### 🏷️ Ritual Tags and Legacy Outcomes

| Tag / Status | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| `Shadow-Faced` | Once per arc, ignore fear, doubt, or illusion through force of will |
| `Shadowbound Ally` | Once per arc, your shadow warns you or grants insight (GM's call) |
| `Haunted (Status)` | Disadvantage on clarity or morale rolls until the shadow is faced again |
| `False Light` | You lied about your victory—others may later sense the truth |

#### 🧭 Narrative Hooks

- Guardians may spot inconsistencies and begin whispering about a "False Light"
- A player might try again—but the second shadow is harder
- A true slaying might awaken something else in the caves
- NPCs who never completed their shadow hunt may still be haunted or twisted by it
- Some mystics believe that befriending the shadow is the truest version—while others call that heresy

## 🗺️ Geography of Niava

Niava is a large world with three known continents, supporting stories that mirror our own world's human conflicts while offering fantasy elements. This is a world where social dynamics, cultural tensions, and collaborative problem-solving drive adventure.

### 🏔️ Continental Geography

#### 🦅 The Claw Continent
Stretches from northwest to south in three massive peninsulas ("talons") separated by mountain ranges exceeding 3,800 heights (roughly 21,000 feet by our measure). These peaks define the horizon across much of the known world.

#### 🥚 The Egg Continent ("Trand")
Located northwest of the Claw. The inhabitants call their home "Trand" (meaning "mud" in their language) due to year-round muddy conditions from daily torrential rains that structure daily life.

#### 🐢 The Turtle Continent
- **Territory:** Three-legged landmass to the south with a distinctive chip in its shell-like outline
- **Philosophy:** "Might makes right" - but fractured and unable to unify behind any single philosophy
- **Government:** Countless petty warlords - baronies, counties, dukedoms in constant warfare over the legendary "Overlord Crown"
- **Economy:** Fragmented and inconsistent; individual lords may have valuable resources but lack coordinated trade
- **Political Status:** Unable to present unified threat or opportunity; too fractured for other continents to take seriously as political entity
- **External Relations:** Minor trade with individual lords, but no continent-wide diplomacy possible

#### ❓ The Mysterious Fourth
An unmapped continent, location unknown.

---

## ⚔️ Major Nations & Powers

### 🏛️ The Dorian Reach (Unified Northern & Central Talons)
- **Territory:** Two northern talons of the Claw continent
- **Peoples:** Hillfolk (northern) and Plainsmen (central) - unified against external threats but maintaining internal cultural friction
- **Philosophy:** "Strength through necessity" - conflict forges character
- **Government:** Dual Council with ultimate authority held by the Champion's Belt winner (earned through the Games)
- **Economy:** Export economy based on training the world's finest athletes/warriors; dependent on imports for food and luxury goods
- **Internal Tension:** Hillfolk value individual prowess vs. Plainsmen team tactics. This rivalry plays out in mixed cities through neighborhood clustering, fighting style preferences, and competitive Games.

### ⚒️ The Iron Shore (Southern Talon)
- **Territory:** Southern talon of the Claw, mountainous and mineral-rich
- **Philosophy:** "Pure strength, pure victory" - views compromise as weakness
- **Government:** Military dictatorship, leaders chosen through single combat  
- **Economy:** Mining and metallurgy - produces the world's finest weapons and armor
- **Relationship:** Views the Dorian Reach as traitors who chose politics over honor; mortal enemies separated by mountain ranges

### 🏢 Trand (The Egg Continent)
- **Territory:** The egg-shaped continent with year-round muddy conditions
- **Philosophy:** "Value the dollar" - profit and economic control above all else
- **Government:** Corporate structure - people organize around whoever's paying them; essentially a fantasy corporate nation-state
- **Economy:** Monopolistic control of the world's bread supply through agricultural dominance
- **Strategic Knowledge:** Aware that Claw cities are unsustainable without food imports, but keeps this knowledge hidden to maintain leverage
- **Environment:** Daily torrential rains force indoor time, leading to intellectual rather than physical development
- **Cultural Evolution:** Indoor time → battles of the mind → economic sophistication → corruption and control → current power structures
- **Power Dynamics:** Operates through hidden economic manipulation; most Claw inhabitants who notice their dependency lack power to act on it
- **External Relations:** Minor trade with Turtle continent but considers them largely irrelevant due to distance

---

## 🚢 Travel & Trade
- **Shipping lanes** connect the continents with regular travel
- **The Mists** - mysterious phenomena that appear and disappear across oceans, sometimes bringing strange ships from unknown places. Usually just normal mist, but occasionally something more...

## 👑 The Crown Bet: Ra's Challenge Explained

### 🎲 The Opportunity
Characters find themselves offered an extraordinary bet by local Games trainers. The Games occur every ten winters (next one is several years away), and achieving seemingly impossible feats earns a featured spot in the competition.

**The Challenge:** Return with the crown of a named king from somewhere in the fractured Turtle continent.

**Multiple Solution Paths:**
- **🤝 Diplomatic:** Negotiate directly with the king
- **💰 Economic:** Purchase the crown through Trand corporate connections
- **⚔️ Martial:** Challenge or defeat the king in combat
- **🎯 Strategic:** Complete a quest for the king to earn the crown
- **🏛️ Political:** Find a way to succeed the king legitimately  
- **🥷 Subterfuge:** Steal the crown through infiltration
- **🤝 Alliance:** Partner with the king's enemies
- **😈 Betrayal:** Use allies to manipulate the situation

**Timeline:** Several years until the Games, allowing for extensive travel, relationship-building, and complex planning.

**Geographic Scope:** Success likely requires navigating all three continental political systems - Claw honor culture, Trand economic networks, and Turtle fractured politics.

This hook showcases Socio-'s collaborative mechanics by requiring multiple approaches and offering numerous valid win conditions beyond simple violence.

## 🍞 The Bread Standard (Economy in Niava)

The Bread Standard is a new economic framework originating from the Society Beyond the Mists. It is not merely a currency system—it is a **philosophy of provision**, designed to eliminate structural suffering and reframe the purpose of wealth.

**🌟 The Living Mythology Made Real:** The Bread Standard represents the translation of the ritual values into economic policy. The Ritual of the Shared Meal becomes universal provision. The Ritual of the Earned Name becomes recognition of inherent dignity. The Ritual of the Silent Audience becomes the right to be heard.

Ten years before the present timeline, the Bread Standard is being piloted by a small island nation within the Turtle continent. Its emergence signals a transition from **scarcity-based economics (Gold Standard)** to a model that centers **human dignity, sufficiency, and creative autonomy**.

### 🧾 Core Principles

- **Basic needs are not luxuries.** Food, clothing, housing, and creative tools are considered baseline provisions.
- **Wealth curves are flattened.** Mechanically, income gains rapidly until Wealth 30, plateau from 30–70, and taper off from 70–100.
- **Homes average 450 value**, achievable without inheritance or lifelong servitude.
- **Provision is systemic, not charitable.** No one must beg or barter for bread.

### 🎲 Economic Mechanics

- Characters earn and spend value normally, but regions under the Bread Standard apply adjusted mechanics:
  - **Faster advancement** from poverty to stability
  - **Wealth caps** reduce extreme disparities
  - **Tags** like `Sponsored`, `Provisional Housing`, or `Creative Stipend` represent social rights, not perks

- Use `Trade`, `Economics`, or `Networking` skills to influence Bread allocations, logistics, or reforms.

- **Validator Points**, A democractic-technocracy in which panels of 'validated' experts are democratically selected by institutions to lead society.

### 🏷️ Common Tags & Statuses

| Tag / Status           | Effect                                                                 |

# 🎭 PART III: CULTURAL DEPTH
*Advanced Content for Rich Storytelling*

---

## 🗣️ Nianic Primer: The Language of Being

*The people Beyond the Mists do not speak in plain words. They speak in glides and structures—each phrase not just a meaning, but a way of being. Nianic is a spoken structure of emotion, identity, and relation.*

---

## 🔤 Word Structure: How to Build a Nianic Word

Each Nianic word is **centered around a verb**. The verb is always **emotionally colored by its vowels**, then **framed by modifiers and pronouns**. Sentences form by combining these words in rhythmic order.

### 🧬 Full Word Structure

[PLACE PREFIX] + [EMOTIONAL VERB] + [PRONOUN SUFFIX] + [TIME SUFFIX]

### 💡 Core Rule
- **Verbs always center the word.**
- **Emotion is encoded through the vowels inside the verb.**
- **Meaning shifts based on order and emotional tone.**

---

## 💓 Emotional Vowels (Glides)

In Nianic, **vowels carry emotion**. They are not decorative—they *define the emotional state* of the verb. Each verb root (e.g., `-nia`, `-tia`, `-zia`) is **inflected** by the vowel at its center.

| Vowel | Emotional Glide       | Meaning Layer                                |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `a`   | Joy / Contentment      | Harmony, pleasure, alignment                  |
| `e`   | Sadness / Grief        | Distress, loss, yearning                      |
| `i`   | Uncertainty / Caution  | Humility, anxiety, trepidation                |
| `o`   | Awe / Excitement       | Enthusiasm, transformation, revelation        |
| `u`   | Anger / Fear           | Urgency, danger, defensiveness, internal storm|

> **Example:**  
> `nia` = to be aligned in joy  
> `nie` = to be aligned through sorrow  
> `niu` = to be aligned while afraid or in anger

> This changes not *what* is said, but *how the speaker feels about what is said*.

You cannot speak truthfully in Nianic without revealing your inner tone.

---

## 🗺️ Component Breakdown

### 🔹 1. Place Prefixes (Where?)

Placed at the **start** of the word to indicate location, origin, or movement.

| Prefix | Meaning         | Example Use         |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| `Tr-`  | Near / with      | Traniavasa (we align soon nearby) |
| `Vu-`  | Above            | Vuniavalo (they rise above in joy) |
| `Pe-`  | Beneath          | Penieva (you suffer beneath) |
| `Ha-`  | Within / inside  | Haniavasa (we align inwardly) |
| `So-`  | Surrounding      | Soniavata (we align during a shared space) |
| `Za-`  | From a distance  | Zuniavako (you fear from afar) |

---

### 🔹 2. Verb Core (What state of being?)

The verb is always **inflected emotionally**. The root **`-ia`** means "to be," but changes meaning depending on consonants and vowel glides.

| Root   | Concept             | Sample Inflections      | Meaning Examples |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| `-nia` | To be aligned / well| `nia`, `nie`, `niu`      | Aligned, sorrowful, threatened |
| `-gia` | To endure / be in pain | `gia`, `gie`, `giu`  | Enduring joyfully, in grief, in rage |
| `-sia` | To flow / let go    | `sia`, `sie`, `siu`      | Yielding, releasing, unraveling |
| `-tia` | To transform        | `tia`, `tie`, `tiu`      | Changing harmoniously or through fear |
| `-zia` | To clarify / perceive | `zia`, `zie`, `ziu`   | Knowing joyfully, sorrowfully, or under pressure |

---

### 🔹 3. Pronoun Suffixes (Who?)

Placed **after the verb** to express the subject or object—who is being, feeling, or acting.

| Suffix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `-i`   | I / Me  |
| `-u`   | You     |
| `-va`  | We / Us |
| `-ti`  | They    |
| `-zo`  | It      |
| `-lo`  | There / the place |

---

### 🔹 4. Time Suffixes (When?)

Placed at the **end** of the word to indicate time, aspect, or temporal feeling.

| Suffix | Meaning         |
|--------|-----------------|
| `-ta`  | During / now     |
| `-sa`  | Soon / in future |
| `-ko`  | Before / past    |
| `-ne`  | Never            |
| `-ra`  | Always           |
| `-ma`  | Cycle / repeat   |

---

## 🔁 Putting It All Together

Let's build an example:

> `Ha + tia + va + ko`

- `Ha-` = within  
- `tia` = to be transformed (joyful glide)  
- `-va` = we  
- `-ko` = in the past  

**Translation:** *We were transformed within.*  
Or idiomatically: *We have changed deeply, before.*

Another:

> `Zuniavasa`  
- `Zu-` = from afar  
- `niu` = to be aligned in fear  
- `-va` = we  
- `-sa` = in the future  

**Translation:** *We will be aligned, fearfully, from afar.*

---

## 📚 Next Section: Verb Expansion

Coming soon: a living lexicon of new Nianic verbs such as:

- **Eat** → `-mia`
- **Drink** → `-lua`
- **Breathe** → `-haa`
- **Sleep** → `-dreia`
- **Void / Empty** → `-krua`
- **Burn** → `-fiia`
- **Remember** → `-lera`

Each of these can be emotionally inflected with vowel glides and combined with the structural prefixes and suffixes above.

> 📌 *The beauty of Nianic is that it grows with use. If a word feels right—sing it into being.*

## 💰 Economics: The Gold Standard

**💳 Characters can purchase any item at or below their Generational Wealth level** during the courtyard phase. Items cost their listed gold value - your daily wealth represents what you can reasonably access without affecting your standard of living.

**⚠️ Economics are not inherently easy.** They are complex and complicated mechanisms for distributing goods and services. Below are supplemental rules for narrators that want to bother with such rules. The rules above are simple and there is no reason not to leave it the only rule established in the gold standard for now.

**💸 Haggler Technique**: If you want to haggle with a merchant, you can purchase items above your wealth level by paying **Base Cost + (Your Daily Wealth × Gold Difference between your wealth and the item's wealth)**. This represents major savings, windfalls, or going into debt for essential equipment.

## 🎭 Running Social Encounters with NPCs

**🎯 Social stances work like tactical positioning** - NPCs declare last after seeing player approaches. When players use Convince (logic), respond with Sympathy (emotion) to counter, or Command (authority) to redirect. NPCs should have clear motivations that drive their stance choices. 

**🤝 Helper cards activate before the main social roll** - the helper must succeed first, then their bonus applies to the primary actor. Failed helpers often make NPCs more suspicious or defensive, increasing difficulty instead of helping. 

**📊 Keep Target Values around 8-12** for normal social challenges, add +1-3 for each additional helper due to coordination complexity. NPCs can change stances between rounds as conversations evolve. Let the dice and player creativity drive outcomes; critical successes might create lasting positive relationships, while critical failures create reputation effects or social complications.

# ⚖️ GM Advice: Edge Cases & Interpretations

For complete skill descriptions, helper card mechanics, and character advancement rules, see the free open-source **Socio- Core Rules** available on GitHub at [link]. This starter module covers the essential mechanics to begin play.

## 🤝 Can Characters Grant Helper Cards to NPCs?

**📝 Situation**: Maria (Support archetype, Teaching d10) wants to coordinate untrained civilians to provide specific assistance during medical emergency.

**🔍 Rules Analysis**:
- **🎓 Teaching skill** explicitly allows "granting temporary access to helper actions"
- **🛡️ Support archetype** specializes in "team coordination" and "empowering others"
- **✅ No explicit restriction** against teaching helpers to NPCs
- **🔗 Community Link helper card** specifically calls in NPC assistance

**⚖️ Ruling: ✅ YES, with limitations**

### 📋 Requirements:
1. **🎓 Character must have Teaching skill** (d6+ recommended)
2. **⏰ Must have time to give instructions** (Minor Action minimum)
3. **👥 NPCs must be willing and capable** (basic intelligence, not panicked)
4. **📉 Helper effects reduced by one tier** when used by untrained NPCs
5. **🔧 Coordination Complexity increases by +2** due to managing untrained helpers

### 💡 Examples:
- **🏥 Field Medic**: Maria can teach bystander to apply pressure to wound
- **🏠 Safe Space**: Maria can guide friend to provide emotional support
- **🔗 Community Link**: Maria naturally activates existing networks

### 🧭 GM Guidelines:
- **🎲 Teaching roll required first** - failure means NPCs can't execute properly
- **📝 Limited to helpers that make narrative sense** - can't teach "Flanking" to civilians
- **⏱️ One-time use** unless character invests time in proper training
- **⚖️ Should feel empowering, not game-breaking**

## 🛒 Equipment Catalog

**📋 How to use the following charts.** There is the **Item** which is its name. There is the **cost** which is how much wealth you need to afford an item. If you can afford the item, you can have the item. Cost at 1 Wealth and USD costs are there for veteran narrators to derive their own understandings of pricing in scenarios set in the Gold Standard.

## 📖 Notes
**🏠 Background**: Daughter of skilled furniture maker (father) and small market vendor (mother). Parents immigrated, built stable middle-class life. Discovered parkour at 14, became local prodigy. Started posting videos at 16, went viral at 18, now has 2.3M followers across platforms.

**📱 Phone Addiction**: Checks notifications every 30 seconds, needs constant validation from likes/comments. Physically uncomfortable when phone battery dies. Makes decisions based on "will this get engagement?" rather than personal safety or relationships.

**⚔️ Rival Drama**: Competitors claim she either uses hidden safety equipment (faking danger) or that her "impressive" stunts are actually basic moves made to look difficult through camera angles. She's particularly targeted by Marcus Kim (@UrbanPhantom) who has 3.8M followers and calls her "suburban parkour princess."

**🎬 Content Style**: Combines genuine athletic skill with strategic camera work. Not fake, but optimized for visual impact. Constantly seeking more impressive locations and stunts to maintain audience growth.

**👤 Personality**: Outwardly confident, internally validation-dependent. Genuinely skilled but struggles with self-worth beyond social metrics. Loyal to fans but competitive with peers. Living entirely in the present moment of content creation.

**📈 Current Situation**: Facing pressure to attempt increasingly dangerous stunts as algorithm changes reduce her reach. Considering collaboration with more extreme creators but worried about maintaining her "accessible athlete" brand.
