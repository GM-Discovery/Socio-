# Introduction

## 10-Second Read: Why This Game?

**Socio-: Stories of Us** is collaborative storytelling where helping others succeed is as mechanically rewarding as helping yourself. Create characters through meaningful life experiences, then face challenges together using a system designed around cooperation, not competition.

---

## 1-Minute Read: What Makes This Different

Traditional RPGs reward individual heroics. This game rewards **socio-collaboration** - the mechanical and narrative benefits of working together.

You'll create characters through a **lifepath system** spanning 10 life stages, from preconception to young adulthood. Each stage shapes who you become through meaningful choices about relationships, talents, and experiences. Then you'll use **helper cards** - specific techniques that let characters assist each other in mechanically powerful ways.

This isn't about one protagonist saving the world. It's about people growing together, facing challenges together, and discovering that the relationships you build are often more important than the obstacles you overcome.

## 3-Minute Read: Tabletop Roleplaying Games

If you've never played a tabletop RPG before, here's what you're getting into: **collaborative storytelling with rules and dice**.

Unlike video games with predetermined outcomes, TTRPGs let you and your friends create stories together. One person (the Game Master or GM) describes situations and plays supporting characters. Everyone else creates and plays a main character. When outcomes are uncertain or dramatic, you roll dice to see what happens.

The dice don't tell the story - they create **dramatic tension**. Will your character succeed at something difficult? The dice help determine the outcome, but you and your friends decide what it means.

### How to Read This Book

- **Chapter 1: Generational Wealth** - Determine your family's economic background
- **Chapter 2: Character Creation** - Build your character through 10 life stages  
- **Chapters 3-4: Core Rules** - Learn the fundamental mechanics
- **Chapters 5-8: Advanced Systems** - Social stances, trauma, collaboration
- **Chapters 9-11: Skills & Equipment** - Detailed references for play

### Basic Dice Rolling

This game uses multiple types of dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 (the number tells you how many sides). 

**Core Resolution**: Roll your dice, add them up, compare to a **Target Value (TV)**. Meet or exceed the target to succeed.

**Exploding Dice**: When you roll the maximum number on a die (like 6 on a d6), roll it again and add the results together. This can chain indefinitely.

**Advantage**: Roll twice, take the better result.  
**Disadvantage**: Roll twice, take the worse result.

---

## Core Concepts: What Makes This Game Unique

### Socio-Collaboration: The Heart of Play

Most RPGs are built around individual characters competing for spotlight time and resources. **Socio-: Stories of Us** mechanically rewards cooperation.

**Helper Cards** are specific techniques that let you assist other players' actions. When you help someone succeed, both of you benefit. The baker can help the warrior by providing nourishing food that removes status effects. The scholar can help the diplomat by providing historical context that grants bonus dice. The warrior can help the crafter by providing intimidating presence during difficult negotiations.

This creates a positive feedback loop: helping others makes everyone more capable, which makes the group more successful, which creates more opportunities to help each other.

### Attributes as Capacity, Not Power

Your **Might** score doesn't determine how strong you are - it determines how many different strength-based skills you can develop. A character with Might 8 can learn up to 8 different physical skills (Melee Combat, Athletics, Grappling, etc.), while a character with Might 3 can only master 3.

This prevents the "weasel trying to arm-wrestle a human" problem. Instead of comparing raw attribute scores, you compare skill levels and dice sizes. The skilled fighter with d12 combat dice will beat the unskilled brute with d4 dice, regardless of their base attributes.

### Universal Resolution with Meaningful Complexity

Everything uses the same core mechanic: **Roll dice vs Target Value**. Whether you're forging a sword, negotiating peace, or fighting cosmic entities, the basic framework stays consistent.

But complexity emerges through **Coordination Complexity** - the additional challenge that comes from working together. Simple assistance adds +1 to the target number. Complex coordination requiring precise timing might add +3 or more. This creates tactical decisions: is the benefit of help worth the coordination overhead?

### Helper Cards and Coordination

**Helper Cards** represent specific ways characters can assist each other, each tied to particular skills and requiring different types of coordination. Some provide bonus dice, others allow rerolls, still others modify the challenge itself.

The person being helped doesn't automatically get the bonus - the helper must succeed at their own skill roll first. This ensures that expertise matters and creates narrative tension around whether assistance will actually help.

### Progression Through Tiers

Characters advance through five **tiers** of play:
- **Street Tier (1-10)**: Local problems, personal conflicts
- **City Tier (11-20)**: Urban challenges, organizational politics  
- **Regional Tier (21-30)**: State-level issues, small wars
- **National Tier (31-40)**: Continental threats, civilization crises
- **Cosmic Tier (41-50)**: Reality-shaping power, universal threats

The same mechanics work at every tier, but the scope and consequences scale dramatically. A Street-tier baker perfecting bread recipes uses the same helper card system as a Cosmic-tier reality-shaper rewriting the laws of physics.

### Lifepath Character Creation

Instead of allocating points to statistics, you create characters by living through their formative experiences. Ten life stages from preconception to young adulthood, each offering meaningful choices about relationships, talents, and life direction.

Your character's capabilities emerge naturally from their lived experiences. The child who spent years studying becomes capable of intellectual leadership. The teenager who learned multiple crafts becomes a versatile creator. The young adult who faced early hardship develops exceptional resilience.

This creates characters with built-in motivations, relationships, and story hooks, while mechanically ensuring that every character contributes meaningfully to group success.

### Safety and Comfort

**Establish boundaries** around content that might be uncomfortable or triggering. This game deals with emotional trauma, social pressure, economic inequality, and interpersonal conflict. Discuss:

- Topics or themes to avoid entirely
- Content that requires advance warning or permission
- Signals for pausing or redirecting uncomfortable scenes
- How to handle character conflicts without player conflicts

**X-Card, Lines and Veils, or similar safety tools** work well with this system. The empathy mechanics and trauma recovery systems create emotional weight—make sure everyone consents to that intensity.

### Group Dynamics

**Review character connections** created during lifepath generation. Which characters know each other? How do their backgrounds intersect? What shared experiences or conflicts exist?

**Discuss collaboration expectations**. This game rewards helping others succeed. Talk about:
- How comfortable everyone is with interdependence
- Whether characters will share resources or maintain individual interests  
- How to handle disagreements about group decisions
- What happens when helper attempts fail or make things worse

### Campaign Foundations

**Establish the world's tone and scope**. Your generational wealth results and lifepath choices have already begun defining the setting. Discuss:
- How much economic inequality exists and how it affects daily life
- Whether magic exists and how common/dangerous it is
- What kinds of problems the characters will face together
- How much the focus will be on personal drama versus external adventure

**Set expectations for Bonds**. These relationships have mechanical weight and will develop during play. Clarify:
- Whether romantic relationships between characters are welcome
- How to handle Bond formation and evolution
- What happens if player relationships affect character Bonds
- Whether NPCs can form meaningful Bonds with characters

### Practical Considerations

**Choose your Narrator** if you haven't already. This person needs to understand the multiple HP pools, social stances, and helper card coordination.

**Plan session length and frequency**. The action scale system works well with longer sessions that allow time for Short and Long actions to matter.

**Discuss character advancement**. Characters grow through using skills in meaningful situations. Will you track this strictly or handle it more narratively?

**Address accessibility needs**. With multiple dice types, complex social mechanics, and emotional content, ensure everyone can participate comfortably.

**Now that you understand the foundations, let's build your character's story together.**

# Chapter 1: Generational Wealth System

## Overview

Before beginning your lifepath, roll for your family's economic situation. Roll 3d20 (exploding once) for each parent to determine their wealth and social standing. This affects your starting resources when you reach adulthood and begin adventuring.

## Mechanics

- **Roll 3d20 for each parent** (each die explodes once on a 20, reroll and add)  
- **Range**: 3-120 (bell curve distribution, most results 50-80)  
- **Coin Flip Opportunity**: If either parent rolls 50+, you may flip a coin to attempt keeping wealth from that side  
- **Failed Transfer**: Failed coin flips equates to circumstances that means the wealth doesn't reach you (family ruin, disinheritance, seizure, etc.)

## Core Concept

# Chapter 5: Core Resolution Mechanics

## Foundation Principle

Every meaningful action in the game uses the same core system: **Roll your dice vs Target Score**. Whether you're forging a legendary sword, negotiating a peace treaty, or battling cosmic entities, the mechanics remain consistent while scaling appropriately to your character's tier and the challenge's magnitude.

## Universal Action Resolution

### The Four-Phase Round

Every round of action \- whether combat, crafting, social negotiation, or any other challenge \- follows the same structure:

**1\. Declaration Phase** *(Initiative Order)* All participants announce their intended actions in initiative order. Be specific about goals and methods.

**2\. Reaction Phase** *(Initiative Order)*  
In initiative order, participants may spend reactions to:

- Cancel or redirect their own declared action  
- Assist another character's action  
- Intercept incoming effects (like bodyguarding)  
- Activate immediate response abilities

**3\. Resolution Phase** *(Simultaneous)* Everyone rolls their dice simultaneously:

- **Primary actors** roll against target scores for their declared actions  
- **Helpers** roll their assistance skills to determine quality of aid  
- **Environmental factors** may require additional rolls

**4\. Narration Phase** The GM describes the combined results of all actions, setting up the next round.

### Core Resolution Mechanics

**Basic Roll**: Attribute \+ Skill level dice vs Target Score

- **Success**: Meet or exceed the target score  
- **Failure**: Fall short of the target score  
- **Critical Success**: Maximum possible roll result  
- **Critical Failure**: Minimum possible roll result (usually all 1s)

**Initiative**: Roll Awareness \+ applicable skill. Higher results act first in declaration and reaction phases.

## Collaborative Resolution System

### Helper Actions

During the Reaction Phase, characters can choose to assist others rather than pursue their own goals. Each type of assistance provides specific benefits but may add coordination complexity to the target score.

### Basic Helper Types

**Advantage Helpers** \- Grant advantage (roll twice, take higher)

- *Flanking*: Combat positioning for attack advantage  
- *Research Support*: Provide background information for analysis  
- *Moral Support*: Encourage during stressful social situations

**Flat Bonus Helpers** \- Add points to the result

- *Intimidation*: \+2 to social pressure rolls through threatening presence  
- *Technical Consulting*: \+1 to \+3 for specialized knowledge application  
- *Quality Materials*: \+1 to \+2 for crafting with superior components

**Reroll Helpers** \- Allow rerolling specific dice results

- *Resource Management*: Reroll 1s on resource consumption checks  
- *Strategic Planning*: Allow reroll of failed tactical decisions  
- *Peer Review*: Reroll one die on analytical or research attempts

**Target Modification Helpers** \- Change the challenge itself

- *Networking*: Reduce social target scores by 2-3 through introductions  
- *Environmental Preparation*: Reduce target scores by 1-2 through optimal setup  
- *Distraction*: Force opponents to use harder target scores

### Coordination Complexity

When multiple people work together, communication overhead can increase the challenge. Add coordination complexity to target scores based on the type and number of helpers:

**Simple Coordination** (+1 to target): Basic assistance requiring minimal communication **Complex Coordination** (+2 to target): Assistance requiring explanation and timing **Tier-Scaled Coordination** (+Tier to target): Assistance that becomes harder at higher power levels **No Coordination** (+0 to target): Actions that don't require communication

## Combat Resolution

### Attack Resolution

**Basic Combat Flow:**

1. **Declaration**: Announce attack type, target, and intended outcome  
2. **Reaction**: Defenders may attempt dodge, parry, or other defensive actions  
3. **Resolution**: Roll attack skill dice  
4. **Outcome Determination**:  
   - **Rolling any 1s**: Narrative miss, no damage dealt, possible complications  
   - **Rolling no 1s**: Automatic hit, roll skill dice as damage

**No Defense Rolls**: Defenders don't roll to avoid attacks. Instead, they can:

- Spend reactions on defensive positioning for narrative advantages  
- Use helper actions to assist the defender  
- Employ environmental factors for protection

### Damage and Health

**Damage Types and Attribute Targeting:** Different attacks target different attribute reserves:

- **Physical attacks**: Target Might reserves  
- **Mental attacks**: Target Intellect reserves  
- **Social attacks**: Target Presence reserves  
- **Spiritual attacks**: Target Spirit reserves  
- **Exhaustion effects**: Target Resolve reserves  
- **Precision attacks**: Target Grace reserves  
- **Emotional attacks**: Target Empathy reserves  
- **Knowledge attacks**: Target Lore reserves  
- **Skill attacks**: Target Craft reserves  
- **Awareness attacks**: Target Awareness reserves

# Chapter 8: Game Mechanics

How to Play - Core Rules Summary
Initiative: The Human Connection
Initiative isn't about your character's speed—it's about you, the players, and your relationships. At the start of each round, the Narrator asks a question that everyone answers. Whoever has the "most" or "best" answer goes first.
Sample Initiative Questions:

"Who has the most houseplants?"
"Who traveled farthest to get here tonight?"
"Whose character has the most complicated relationship right now?"
"Who would [important NPC] trust most in this situation?"
"Who made the best snack for tonight's session?"
"Whose character is most emotionally invested in what's happening?"

Rotate questions every round. Everyone should get chances to go first.
Why This Works: Your turns happen simultaneously, but resolve in order of initiative. Paul starts talking to the zombie, everyone decides how to assist, and Peter's readied attack becomes something entirely different. The question creates natural conversation and ensures spotlight rotation.

Zones: Contextual Distance
Zones are relative to the situation, not precise measurements:

Near: Within arm's reach, immediate contact
Middle: A few steps away, across a room
Far: Outside a second of running, other side of a courtyard
Distant: More than 5 seconds of running, requires planning to reach

Context Matters: "Far" in a cramped tavern is different from "Far" on a battlefield. The Narrator sets scale based on what makes sense for the scene.
Movement: Spend a Minor Action to move one zone, or a Major Action to move two zones. Athletics or other skills may allow faster movement.

Narrator Guidance: Story First
Your job is helping players have fun through story, not managing rules complexity.
Core Principle: Make things make sense as simply as possible. Players should be doing story, not wrestling with mechanics.
Setting Challenge Values:

Use the tier-based tables in Chapter 6
When in doubt, Normal difficulty (middle of their tier range)
Add +1 to +3 for complications, environmental factors, or time pressure
Remember: well-prepared characters should succeed about 50% of the time on Normal challenges

Managing Collaboration:

Let players describe what they're trying to help with
Don't worry about perfect optimization—if it makes narrative sense, it probably works
Coordination complexity adds challenge, but don't let it bog down the flow
The helper succeeds first, then their help applies to the main action

Social Stances:

Players can change stances freely—it's about finding what works
Stances counter each other, but it's not rock-paper-scissors combat
Focus on the conversation and let mechanical bonuses support the roleplay
When in doubt, ask "What are you actually trying to accomplish here?"

Fate Points:

Give 1-3 per session for great character moments, creative solutions, or collaborative play
Players also gain 1 Fate Point every time they advance a skill
Don't be stingy—Fate Points make the game more fun

Remember: The rules serve the story. If something isn't working, talk it through and adjust. Your players' fun matters more than perfect mechanical execution.

## Core Concept \- Action Scales and Timing Framework

Different skills operate on different time scales, creating tactical vulnerability and meaningful choices. Starting a long-duration action commits you to that timeline, making you vulnerable to interruption and unable to respond to immediate threats.

---

## The Four Action Scales

### Instant Actions (Seconds)

**Duration**: Single combat rounds, immediate responses **Examples**: Sword attacks, dodge attempts, quick social reactions, danger responses, simple spells **Tactical Notes**:

- All participants act in initiative order  
- Helpers must be in position and ready  
- No commitment vulnerability

### Short Actions (Minutes)

**Duration**: Complex tasks requiring sustained focus **Examples**: Detailed crafting steps, negotiations, intermediate spells, picking complex locks **Tactical Notes**:

- Initiative matters but actions span multiple rounds  
- Starting commits you until completion or interruption  
- Moderate vulnerability to disruption

### Long Actions (Hours to Days)

**Duration**: Substantial projects requiring dedicated time **Examples**: Baking bread, research sessions, building furniture, advanced spells, masterwork crafting **Tactical Notes**:

- Participants drop out of combat initiative  
- Highly vulnerable to interruption  
- Requires relatively safe environment  
- Cannot respond to immediate threats while engaged

### Extended Actions (Weeks to Years)

**Duration**: Major projects and campaigns **Examples**: Architecture projects, political movements, master craftsmanship, legendary magical workings **Tactical Notes**:

- GM breaks into discrete tasks with individual skill rolls  
- "Place this stone correctly" not "build entire cathedral"  
- Progress measured in completed sub-tasks  
- Campaign-level time investment

---

## Interruption Mechanics

### Interruption Categories

#### Persistent Progress (Physical Construction)

**Examples**: Architecture, furniture making, road building, stonework **Interruption Effect**: Pick up exactly where you left off **Materials**: No waste, work persists indefinitely

#### Volatile Processes (Dangerous/Unstable)

**Examples**: Magical summoning, explosive creation, unstable chemistry, portal opening **Interruption Effect**: Must start completely over from beginning **Materials**: All components/materials consumed regardless of progress

#### Focus-Dependent (Mental/Creative Work)

**Examples**: Musical composition, complex research, strategic planning, spell research **Interruption Effect**: Lose 1d4 progress steps backward **Materials**: Work persists but concentration broken, must rebuild mental framework

#### Material-Sensitive (Timing-Critical Crafting)

**Examples**: Baking, potion brewing, metallurgy, timed chemical processes **Interruption Effect**: Materials wasted if interrupted at wrong moment **Safe Pause Points**: Available for Long+ duration tasks at GM discretion

---

## Concentration Checks

### When Concentration Checks Occur

- External distractions threaten ongoing actions  
- Combat erupts near long-duration tasks  
- Environmental hazards create disruption  
- Social pressure interrupts mental work

### Distraction Challenge Values

| Distraction Level | CV | Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Minor | 8 | Distant shouting, weather changes, background noise |
| Moderate | 12 | Nearby combat, loud crashes, heated arguments |
| Major | 16 | Direct threats, explosions, building damage |
| Extreme | 20+ | Being attacked, building collapsing, magical catastrophe |

### Concentration Check Sequence

1. **Main Actor Rolls**: Resolve vs. distraction CV  
2. **Helper Bonuses Determined**:  
   - Main actor **succeeds**: Helpers get \+1 (good leadership coordination)  
   - Main actor **fails**: Helpers get **disadvantage** (no coordination guidance)  
3. **Each Helper Rolls**: Resolve \+ modifier vs. same CV  
4. **Results Applied**:  
   - Failed main actor: Loses 1d4 progress steps (Focus-Dependent tasks)  
   - Failed helpers: Must re-establish coordination (costs 1 action/round)

### Concentration Check Results

#### Main Actor Failure

- **Focus-Dependent tasks**: Lose 1d4 progress steps  
- **Volatile Processes**: Complete restart required  
- **Material-Sensitive**: Waste materials (unless at safe pause point)  
- **Persistent Progress**: No progress loss, just time delay

#### Helper Failure

- Loses coordination with main actor  
- Must spend 1 action re-establishing assistance  
- Cannot provide bonuses until re-coordinated  
- If main actor lost significant progress, may need to restart entirely

---

## Helper Coordination Rules

### Initial Coordination

- Helpers must establish coordination before providing bonuses  
- Takes 1 action per helper to organize  
- Multiple helpers increase complexity (see Core Mechanics)

### Maintaining Coordination

- Automatic during uninterrupted work  
- Requires concentration checks during distractions  
- Failed helpers lose coordination individually

### Re-establishing Coordination

- Required after failed concentration checks  
- Takes 1 action: asking questions, getting repositioned, understanding current progress  
- Main actor must not be in middle of Volatile Process

### Coordination Limitations

- Helpers working on different action scales cannot coordinate  
- Instant helpers cannot assist Long actions (and vice versa)  
- Mixed-scale projects require careful timing and planning

---

## Tactical Implications

### Vulnerability Windows

- **Long Actions**: Cannot defend, dodge, or respond to immediate threats  
- **Short Actions**: Limited defensive options, delayed reactions  
- **Volatile Processes**: Interruption wastes everything invested  
- **Focus-Dependent**: Interruption sets back mental progress significantly

### Strategic Timing

- Starting dangerous rituals requires security planning  
- Long crafting projects need safe locations  
- Battlefield spellcasting creates target opportunities  
- Helper commitment affects group tactical flexibility

### Meaningful Choices

- Risk vs. reward in timing decisions  
- Resource investment vs. safety considerations  
- Individual advancement vs. group tactical needs  
- Immediate response vs. long-term project completion

---

## Examples in Play

### Example 1: Battlefield Baking

**Situation**: Baker starts bread during combat (Long Action) **Consequence**: Cannot dodge, attack, or help others until bread completes **Interruption**: Enemy attack forces Concentration check **Result**: Failed check ruins the bread, baker wasted time and materials

### Example 2: Interrupted Research

**Situation**: Scholar researching ancient text (Focus-Dependent, Short Action) **Interruption**: Building explodes nearby (Major distraction, CV 16\) **Check**: Scholar fails Resolve check **Result**: Loses 1d4 steps of research progress, must rebuild understanding

### Example 3: Coordinated Construction

**Situation**: Architect directing 20 workers placing massive stone (Persistent Progress, Long Action) **Interruption**: Dragon roars overhead (Major distraction, CV 16\) **Checks**:

- Architect succeeds Resolve check → workers get \+1 bonus  
- 18/20 workers succeed → continue working  
- 2 workers fail → spend next round asking "what were we doing?" **Result**: Minor delay, no progress lost, work continues efficiently

### Example 4: Volatile Magical Summoning

**Situation**: Mage summoning elemental (Volatile Process, Short Action) **Interruption**: Attacked by enemy (Extreme distraction, CV 20+) **Check**: Mage fails Resolve check **Result**: Summoning fails completely, all magical components consumed, must start over

## 🏷️ Tags & Traits: Narrative Flags with Mechanical Teeth
Tags and traits act as mechanical flags — short descriptors that carry mechanical weight and narrative significance. They’re how the system tracks states like Bonded, Blessed, Cursed, or Marked, and they're referenced by skills, helper cards, archetypes, and future expansions.

### 🔹 TAGS
Definition: Tags are conditions or identities that influence access, eligibility, or bonuses.

Descriptive	Fluff or narrative-only, often RP flavor	Smells Like Bread, Song in Soul
Functional	Used in helper card or ability prerequisites	Bonded, Blessed, Criminal Record
Requirement	Gated tags; unlock specific abilities or techniques	Divinely Touched, Arcane Marked

### 🧷 Requirement Tags
Some tags are required to use specific content — helper cards, techniques, or narrative abilities. If a card says “Requires: Bonded,” then you must have that tag to use it.

### 🔧 Gaining Tags
Tags are gained through:

Lifepath results (e.g., Bonded, Cursed, Lineage Marked)

Completing quests, rituals, or dramatic events

Receiving techniques, titles, or special statuses

Being targeted by major effects or world-altering events

### 🧽 Clearing Tags
Some tags are permanent. Others can be cleared with:

Skills like Therapy, Ritual, or Mediation

Narrative acts (breaking a vow, severing a bond)

Fate Point expenditure, GM discretion

## 💠 TRAITS
Traits are permanent enhancements or quirks chosen during lifepath or character creation. Unlike Tags, they always come with mechanical or narrative effects.

## 🧬 Trait Sources
Lifepath selections (e.g., Silver Tongue, Ancestral Connection), Fate Point choices

Major accomplishments

Purchased via Fate Points (future expansion)

Tied to specific tags (e.g., having Bonded allows the Fated Twin trait)

#### 🛠 Trait Example: Fated Twin
Requires Tag: Bonded
Effect: Once per session, you or your bonded twin may spend a Fate Point to allow the other to reroll any failed roll. If both players agree, they may spend a Fate Point each to prevent a fatal outcome for the other once per campaign.

### 🧪 Design Note: Tags vs Traits
Feature	Tags	Traits
Can expire?	Yes	No (usually)
Grant powers?	No, but may be required for them	Yes
Narrative impact?	High	High
Skill interaction?	Often	Always
Appears on cards?	As requirement	As ability name or source

### ⚔️ The Shape of Threats
“A threat is not just what swings a sword, but what shapes your decisions.”

In Socio-: Stories of Us, threats are not simply enemies. They are friction, they are pressure. They are the world’s insistence that you act, change, or fail. Whether they come with teeth, trauma, ideology, or invitations, each threat you face defines what kind of person your character becomes.

This section lays out how to construct, scale, and deploy threats across the tiers of play, using short-form stat blocks, universal mechanics, and your own narrative instincts.

### 🧠 Threats Use the Same System as PCs
Opponents in this world are built with the same architecture as players:

They have attributes, each with a corresponding HP pool.

They can use stances (often hidden until action is resolved).

They can take actions, reactions, and helpers, just like PCs.

They may possess tags and trigger statuses the same way.

Their abilities scale with the tier of the encounter, not narrative flavor alone.

A street-tier bureaucrat with an Overwhelming Policy tag can do as much emotional damage to a player as a regional-tier death priest—if not more.

### 📦 Short-Form Threat Blocks
While major NPCs may use full character sheets, most threats should be simple:

**NAME**: Agonizing Warden  
**Tier**: Street (TV 6)  
**HP Pools**: Might 25, Resolve 30, Presence 20  
**Skills**: Intimidation d8, Command d6, Punishment d4  
**Tags**: `Authority`, `Cold Gaze`, `Cycle of Pain`  
**Abilities**:
- **Break the Spirit** (Reaction): When an ally fails a Resolve or Presence roll, the Warden gains +1d6 on its next social action against them.  
- **Punish the Weak** (Helper): If an enemy is `Wounded` or `Numb`, add +2 to attack TV against them.  
- **Cycle of Pain** (Passive): Characters who take HP damage from this threat roll with disadvantage on social rolls next scene unless healed.

Use these abilities as shorthand for narrative outcomes. They're not exhaustive—merely enough to keep the scene tactical and reactive.

### 📉 Threat Value (TV) as Encounter Budget
Each threat has a Threat Value, a number representing its mechanical potency and psychological pressure. Like CR in other systems, it allows you to design fair or unfair fights intentionally.

TV Calculation Factors:

Attribute HP Pools (base capacity × tier scaling)

Dice size of key skills

Number and potency of helper-style effects

Tags that apply persistent pressure or status effects

Defensive capabilities (passive resistance, evasion, support helpers)

### 📊 You can sum up encounter TV by adding each opponent’s TV, then comparing to the party's tier and number. Rule of thumb:

TV = ~Tier × 1.5 for a solo boss

TV = ~Tier × 0.75 × Number of Enemies for groups

### 🧷 Tags as Threat Multipliers
Tags are the true signal of how a threat warps the world around it.

Examples:

Obsession — the threat cannot retreat until it has broken a PC’s will

Cursed — spreads magical status conditions on hit

Corrupting Voice — targets Empathy or Lore HP instead of Presence

Tags can be cured, triggered, resisted, or invoked. They are narrative levers with mechanical bite.

### 🦠 Swarms and Crowds
Unless specified, crowds are treated as a single threat unit with:

Shared HP pool

Tier-matching dice

Reaction economy = number of swarm fragments

Once the players disrupt or divide a swarm (via area control, social fracture, or panic), break it into smaller threats with their own stats.

#### 🎭 Treat fear, disgust, loyalty, and solidarity as HP pools when relevant—especially for ideological mobs.

### 🧱 Threats Beyond the Body
Threats can be:

Emotional: An abusive mentor, a manipulative romance

Institutional: Eviction orders, corrupt judges, a collapsing healthcare system

Ideological: A belief that must be unmade in the people

Existential: Silence where sound should be, absence of the sacred

These are not “side content.” They are canonical gameplay in Socio-.

Design these threats with HP pools in Presence, Lore, Spirit, or Empathy. Let them act like any other threat—but their attacks may be sermons, laws, media broadcasts, or personal betrayals.


## GM Guidelines

### Setting Appropriate Challenge Values

- Consider proximity and severity of distraction  
- Account for character preparation and safety measures  
- Multiple simultaneous distractions may increase CV  
- Environmental factors can modify base CV

### Managing Mixed Action Scales

- Track which characters are committed to longer actions  
- Remind players of vulnerability before they commit  
- Create meaningful choices between safety and efficiency  
- Use interruption threats to create tension

### Balancing Progress and Safety

- Provide safe pause points for reasonable tasks  
- Don't punish players for logical precautions  
- Create encounters where timing pressure matters  
- Reward strategic thinking about action scale choices

### Helper Coordination Narrative

- Describe how coordination actually works  
- Make failed re-establishment feel natural  
- Show the benefit of good leadership during crises  
- Use concentration mechanics to create collaborative tension

---

## Integration Notes

### With Combat System

- Long/Extended actions remove characters from initiative  
- Concentration checks use combat-timing for resolution  
- Area effects may trigger concentration checks for nearby workers  
- Tactical positioning affects vulnerability to interruption

### With Skill System

- Each skill should specify its typical action scale  
- Some skills may work at multiple scales (different applications)  
- Skill level may affect vulnerability to interruption  
- Master craftsmen might get concentration bonuses

### With Archetype System

- Different archetypes favor different action scales  
- Combat archetypes excel at Instant actions  
- Craft archetypes specialize in Long/Extended actions  
- Support archetypes coordinate across scale differences  
- Knowledge archetypes often work in Focus-Dependent tasks

---

## 🌡️ Exposure Effects (Endurance Skill Integration)

| Environment | Base CV | Effects on Failure |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Extreme Heat** | 10 | Gain `Winded`, lose 1 Focus HP/day |
| **Freezing Cold** | 12 | Gain `Frozen`, lose 1 Might HP/day |
| **Starvation** | 8 | Gain `Exhausted`, 1 HP loss per missed meal |
| **Dehydration** | 9 | `Winded` becomes `Numb`, \+1 CV to all rolls |
| **Toxic Air** | 13 | Roll vs Endurance or gain `Overstimulated` |
| **Suffocation** | 14 | 1d4 Might damage per round after limit |

Failures accrue cumulative penalties if not addressed. Use Helper Cards, terrain prep, or resolve tests to resist.

## Design Philosophy

This system creates **meaningful tactical choices** where timing becomes a strategic resource. Players must weigh immediate safety against long-term progress, individual advancement against group tactical needs, and risk against reward.

The concentration check system ensures that **leadership matters** \- skilled coordinators help their teams maintain focus under pressure, while poor leadership during crisis leaves helpers confused and ineffective.

Most importantly, this framework makes **every action scale feel important** \- the baker's bread-making is as mechanically interesting and tactically relevant as the warrior's sword work, each carrying appropriate risks and rewards for their chosen timing.

## ✨ Core Concept \- Status Systems

All characters in the game have attribute-based health pools. Each core attribute governs its own type of HP:

| Attribute | HP Pool | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Might | Health | Physical durability and bodily injury |
| Intellect | Psyche | Cognitive load and mental stability |
| Grace | Motion | Agility, reflex, and fine motor strain |
| Presence | Will | Social and expressive stamina |
| Spirit | Essence | Spiritual and metaphysical cohesion |
| Resolve | Focus | Emotional and endurance capacity |
| Awareness | Perception | Sensory overload and situational processing |
| Empathy | Heart | Emotional openness and vulnerability |

---

## 📊 Attribute-Based HP Calculation

HP \= (Attribute × Tier Multiplier) \+ Tier Bonus

| Tier | Multiplier | Bonus |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | x10 | \+5 |
| 2 | x12 | \+10 |
| 3 | x15 | \+20 |
| 4 | x18 | \+30 |
| 5 | x22 | \+40 |

Each attribute has its **own HP pool**, and damage can target any depending on the nature of the attack (physical, mental, social, spiritual, etc.).

---

## ❌ HP Depletion Consequences

- **When an HP pool hits 0**, the character suffers:  
  - **Unconsciousness or Collapse** for that attribute type  
  - **Permanent \-1 to the governing attribute** until healed by appropriate means (e.g., surgery, therapy, spiritual healing)

### Attribute-Specific Collapse:

- **Might (Health)**: Fall unconscious; at 0 Might, *death*.  
- **Intellect (Psyche)**: Enter catatonia or coma.  
- **Grace (Motion)**: Paralyzed or incapacitated.  
- **Presence (Will)**: Social withdrawal or identity break.  
- **Spirit (Essence)**: Astral dissociation or soul loss.  
- **Resolve (Focus)**: Mental breakdown or dissociation.  
- **Awareness (Perception)**: Sensory blackout, hallucination, disconnection from environment.  
- **Empathy (Heart)**: Emotional shutdown, depersonalization.

---

## 🕵️ Duration & Recovery

- Attribute damage heals **only** through specific skills, rest, helper cards, or narrative tools.  
- Some may linger indefinitely without care (e.g., emotional wounds).

---

## 🔹 Status Conditions Glossary (Work in Progress)

**Status \= a temporary or lasting condition that affects rolls, limits options, or changes narrative tone.**

### ⚡ Physical Statuses (Might/Grace)

- **Raw**: \+1 EP per Might/Grace action.  
- **Winded**: Cannot use reaction-based helpers.  
- **Wounded (1-3)**: \+1 to \+3 TV on all physical actions.  
- **Limping**: \+2 TV to Grace checks.  
- **Burning**: Take damage each round until doused.

### 🔦 Mental/Emotional (Resolve/Intellect/Empathy)

- **Haunted**: Disadvantage on Resolve or Empathy rolls.  
- **Numb**: Cannot spend Fate Points.  
- **Obsessed**: Must pursue defined narrative goal or gain 1 EP per scene.  
- **Fragmented**: Roll d6 at start of scene; 1–2 \= lose 1 action.  
- **Overstimulated**: Disadvantage on Awareness and Intellect rolls.

### ✨ Spiritual (Spirit/Presence)

- **Unmoored**: Cannot enter Astral State.  
- **Inspired**: \+1 die to Spirit or Presence rolls.  
- **Shadowbound**: When alone, must roll Resolve or hallucinate.  
- **Sanctified**: Nearby allies gain \+1 to resist fragmentation, fear, or charm.  
- **Radiant**: One helper card you use auto-succeeds this scene.

---

## ⚖️ Status Mechanics

- **Apply**: From failed rolls, helper consequences, harm, or narrative triggers.  
- **Clear**: Via rest, support skills (Recovery, Therapy), or helper cards.  
- **Stack**: Some statuses escalate (Wounded 1→2→3), others overwrite (Inspired replaces Numb).  
- **Track**: Use character sheet tokens, notches, or condition flags.

---

*Status conditions and attribute-based HP deepen gameplay, connect skills and archetypes, and allow characters to be harmed, transformed, or strengthened in more ways than just physical combat.*

## 🎮 TBD Action Economy & Tier 0 Universal Actions

---

### 🔄 Core Action Economy (Per Round)

| Action Type | Quantity | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Major Action** | 1 | Attacks, skill-based acts, long moves, heavy interactions |
| **Minor Action** | 1 (or up to 3 total by converting Major) | Quick interactions, draws, movement, fast helper cards |
| **Reactions** | Varies by skill | Used in response to triggers (attack incoming, ally action, spell cast, etc.) |

➡️ You may convert **1 Major Action into 2 Minor Actions**, giving a total of up to **3 Minor Actions per round**.

---

### 🧰 Tier 0 Actions (No Skill Required)

| Action | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Move** | Minor | Shift position within a zone or to adjacent zone |
| **Talk** | Minor | Communicate intention, rally allies, shout warnings |
| **Attack (Untrained)** | Major | 1 damage on hit; no crits, no status effects |
| **Drop** | Free | Let go of item, burden, or grip |
| **Grab** | Major | Attempt to seize object/person (contested Might roll) |
| **Interact** | Minor or Major | Pull lever, open door, use object, throw item |
| **Observe** | Minor | Make a basic perception effort (better with Awareness) |
| **Help (Basic)** | Minor | Aid another’s action; at disadvantage if untrained |
| **Block (Basic)** | Reaction | Reduce damage from melee or projectile; see below |
| **Dodge (Basic)** | Reaction | Attempt to avoid all damage from one source; see below |

---

### 🛡 Block vs Dodge (Expanded Mechanics)

| Action | Type | Roll | Effect | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Block** | Reaction | *Might \+ Gear (if any)* vs Attack TV | Reduces damage by **(Roll ÷ 2, rounded up)** | Can reduce damage to 0, not below. Requires free hand or shield. |
| **Full Block** | Major Action | *Might \+ Gear* | Blocks all attacks from one source this round | Cannot move this round; stance-based |
| **Dodge** | Reaction | *Grace \+ Awareness* vs Attack TV | Avoids **all** damage on success | May move 1 zone if successful |
| **Full Dodge** | Major Action | *Grace \+ Awareness* vs highest incoming Attack TV | Avoid all damage this round | Grants \+2 to dodge roll if not encumbered |

➡️ **Block \= mitigate**, **Dodge \= negate** — both can be enhanced with skills (e.g., Parry, Redirect, Phase Step)

---

### ⚠️ Reaction Limit

Characters may use **1 Reaction per round by default**, unless a skill, item, or helper card says otherwise.

Some archetypes may gain additional reactions, or “pre-spend” reactions at a cost.

---

## ⚔️ Action Economy & Timing Framework

In social and narrative conflict, every participant operates within a shared initiative framework.

Initiative determines order of actions.

Reactions are limited to 1 per round unless otherwise stated.

Actions are divided by tempo:

- **Fast (1 beat)**: Single action or quick interjection  
- **Standard (2 beats)**: Normal turn pace  
- **Slow (3+ beats)**: Monologues, complex plans, deep reads (may be interrupted if not defended or supported)

➡️ Fast actions resolve first, allowing quick responses or disruptions before slower moves land.

This structure governs both physical and social scenes, enabling risk/reward decisions around pacing, commitment, and timing.

## 🧠 Social Stance System Overview

TBD uses a dynamic social stance system to represent rhetorical positioning in dialogue, conflict, and manipulation. Players adopt a stance to shape their influence during social encounters. Each stance excels against one, and is vulnerable to another, forming a counterplay cycle.

Stances are not merely about winning an argument—they're about framing the conversation and defining what "effective" even means.

### 🔁 Stance Counter-Wheel

| Stance | Beats | Weak To |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Convince** | Command | Sympathy |
| **Sympathy** | Convince | Insight |
| **Insight** | Sympathy | Command |
| **Command** | Insight | Follow |
| **Follow** | Command | Convince |

#### Individual Stances

### 🔍 Stance: Convince

*"If they understood the truth, they'd agree."*

**Core Tactic**: Uses reason, evidence, and structured arguments.

**Beats**: Command (undermines authority through logic)  
**Weak To**: Sympathy (emotional appeals ignore logic)

#### 🎮 Actions

| Action | Effect |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Present Evidence** | Apply "Discredited" status to opponent unless countered |
| **Catch Contradiction** | Force opponent to reroll or lose next social action |
| **Appeal to Consistency** | \+1 Bonus Die (1d4) if target shares a declared value |
| **Structured Rebuttal** | Negate stance bonus from Sympathy this round |

#### ❌ Risks

- Ineffective against emotional arguments  
- May come off as condescending; can trigger Resentment  
- Can be baited into over-explaining (status: Overextended)

---

### 💞 Stance: Sympathy

*"They don't care what you know until they know that you care."*

**Core Tactic**: Uses emotional resonance, vulnerability, or shared humanity to gain traction.

**Beats**: Convince (deflects or overrides logic with feeling)  
**Weak To**: Insight (reveals misaligned or manipulative emotional appeals)

#### 🎮 Actions

| Action | Effect |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Personal Disclosure** | Apply "Humanized" status; target suffers \-1 to hostile social actions |
| **Empathic Mirror** | Copy a minor status or emotional stance from target |
| **Share Pain** | Reduce tension or hostility; restore 1 EP to target |
| **Emotional Redirect** | Change the target of an ongoing social attack |

#### ❌ Risks

- May be seen as performative if overused (status: Insincere)  
- Vulnerable to gentle redirection from Insight, which may shift the emotional tone away from the speaker's control (status: Disarmed)  
- Can result in emotional bleed if the stance becomes too porous or personal (status: Overidentified)

---

### 🔎 Stance: Insight

*"What's true doesn't need to shout."*

**Core Tactic**: Uses observation, pattern recognition, and emotional clarity to expose unseen dynamics.

**Beats**: Sympathy (uncovers performance or misalignment in emotional framing)  
**Weak To**: Command (may be dismissed or overridden by forceful structure)

#### 🎮 Actions

| Action | Effect |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Read the Room** | Learn the current stance of one target or detect hidden goals |
| **Subtle Callout** | Apply "Unstable" status: next action by target suffers \-1 die |
| **Clarify Intention** | Remove 1 misleading status from self or ally (e.g., Insincere, Discredited) |
| **De-escalate** | Cancel bonus effect from another stance action this round |

#### ❌ Risks

- May lack immediate influence in high-pressure environments  
- Risks appearing passive, evasive, or overly critical (status: Aloof)  
- May be interrupted or talked over if not respected (status: Dismissed)

➡️ Insight can gently disrupt any stance — reducing its impact without escalating the conflict. It is most potent against Sympathy, but offers versatile disruption across the wheel.

---

### 🧱 Stance: Command

*"I said move."*

**Core Tactic**: Uses certainty, authority, and presence to direct behavior or seize control of the frame.

**Beats**: Insight (disrupts reflection and clarity through urgency or structure)  
**Weak To**: Follow (obedience defuses dominance and creates ambiguity)

#### 🎮 Actions

| Action | Effect |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Issue Order** | Target must choose to comply or suffer \-1 die on next social roll |
| **Establish Dominance** | Gain "Commanding" status; targets without Bonded tag suffer \-1 to resist your effects |
| **Interrupt** | Cancel or delay a stance-based action taken by a lower-tier character |
| **Rally Force** | Allies gain \+1 die to their next stance-based action if they follow your lead |

#### ❌ Risks

- Can provoke resentment or backlash if overused (status: Overbearing)  
- Easily countered by humility or mimicry (Follow)  
- May escalate situations unnecessarily (status: Provoked)

➡️ Command is ideal for initiating structure, asserting presence, and forcing fast compliance—but brittle against cooperative subversion.

---

### 🪞 Stance: Follow

*"Sure, whatever you say..."*

**Core Tactic**: Uses humility, deference, or perceived submission to defuse threats, disarm authority, or control perception.

**Beats**: Command (turns dominance into awkward overreach)  
**Weak To**: Convince (logic cuts through the performance and uncovers avoidance)

#### 🎮 Actions

| Action | Effect |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Yield the Floor** | Avoids all penalties from a hostile stance action this round |
| **Play Along** | Mimic another stance and gain \+1 Bonus Die (1d4) to the action |
| **Fade Into the Crowd** | Remove 1 targeted status; next social attack has disadvantage against you |
| **Echo Their Words** | Force target to reroll their last stance-based effect |

#### ❌ Risks

- May appear weak or unprincipled (status: Passive)  
- Can be co-opted by stronger personalities (status: Undermined)  
- Difficult to rally support or make bold moves when needed (status: Doubtful)

➡️ Follow confuses control structures by seeming compliant while shaping the flow from below. It excels in long games and relational settings.

## 🎭 Stance Modifiers: Environmental & Contextual Bonuses

Stances may gain advantage or disadvantage depending on the environment, social terrain, or audience disposition.

| Modifier Type | Condition Met | Effect |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Audience Bias** | Crowd values logic, order, or fairness | \+1 die to Convince |
| **Emotional Tension** | Scene charged with grief, anger, or love | \+1 die to Sympathy |
| **Hidden Agendas** | Players suspect secrets or manipulations | \+1 die to Insight |
| **Power Structure** | Strong hierarchy or official chain of command | \+1 die to Command |
| **Diffuse Setting** | Informal or ambiguous group dynamics | \+1 die to Follow |
| **Spotlight** | Player is center of attention voluntarily | \+1 die to their stance action |
| **Offstage Maneuver** | Player speaks quietly, subtly, or to the side | \+1 to avoid backlash if action fails |

Modifiers stack if narrative and context allow, and can be offset or negated by opposing stances or insight-based actions.

## 🎬 Narrative Consequences of Stance Outcomes

Victory, defeat, or draw in a stance-based exchange has ripple effects beyond the roll.

| Outcome Type | Description | Narrative Result Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Win** | Player's stance dominates the exchange | Gain audience support, shift tone, apply status |
| **Loss** | Player is rhetorically defeated | Suffer backlash, status, or reposition in hierarchy |
| **Draw** | Standoff; tension lingers | Add unresolved tension to next round or trigger retort |
| **Critical Win** | Player wins with overwhelming clarity | Gain long-term influence or group shift (e.g., deference) |
| **Critical Loss** | Player loses with narrative exposure | Trigger discrediting, betrayal, shame, or scene exit |

Statuses applied include Resentment, Discredited, Commanding, Humanized, Overextended, Undermined, etc.

➡️ These consequences should be interpreted collaboratively, with GM support or player consensus as needed.

## 🧠 Trauma Support & Recovery System

Trauma in Open Source RPG is represented by depletion of mental, emotional, and focus-based HP pools:

| Attribute | Trauma Type | HP Pool | Collapse Effect |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Intellect** | Cognitive Overload | Psyche | Catatonia, memory loss, cognitive freeze |
| **Empathy** | Emotional Wounding | Heart | Emotional numbness, depersonalization |
| **Resolve** | Stress & Burnout | Focus | Mental breakdown, disassociation, collapse |

---

### 🩹 Natural Healing Framework

Trauma recovery is **slow without support**, but specific skills and helper cards accelerate the process.

#### ⏳ Natural Healing (Unaided)

| Attribute | Self-Recovery Rate | Requirement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Psyche** | 1 HP/week | Complete solitude or mentally quiet space |
| **Heart** | 1 HP/3 days | Bonded companion or emotionally safe setting |
| **Focus** | 1 HP/day | No active stressors for 24 hours |

---

### 💖 Accelerated Healing (With Help)

Use support-focused skills to boost recovery:

| Skill | Attribute | Effect |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Therapy** | Empathy | \+1 Heart, remove 1 emotional status |
| **Comfort** | Empathy | Removes `Numb`, `Haunted`, or `Overidentified` |
| **Counseling** | Empathy | Heals 1 HP of Heart or Focus with narrative support |
| **Recovery** | Resolve | \+1 Focus per rest cycle |
| **Psychology** | Empathy | Grants \+1 to recovery rolls for trauma HP |
| **Teaching** | Empathy | Restores identity or ability loss post-collapse |

➡️ Use skill rolls vs. CV 8–14 to determine how effective each session is.

---

## 🃏 Trauma Helper Cards

Helper cards support recovery from trauma conditions. These can be earned, bought, or selected through archetype perks.

### 🟦 **Guided Breathwork**

- **Skill**: Meditation or Comfort  
- **Action**: Slow (3 beats)  
- **Effect**: Remove `Overstimulated` or `Fragmented`, restore 1 Focus HP

---

### 💜 **Shared Burden**

- **Skill**: Therapy or Counseling  
- **Action**: Standard (2 beats)  
- **Effect**: Ally rerolls a failed Psyche or Heart recovery roll. Removes `Numb` for 1 scene.

---

### 🌿 **Grounding Ritual**

- **Skill**: Spirit \+ Resolve  
- **Action**: Short (minutes)  
- **Effect**: Clears `Haunted` or `Unmoored`. Prevents further trauma statuses for 6 hours.

---

### 🎭 **Mirror Session**

- **Skill**: Reading Emotions \+ Psychology  
- **Action**: Long (hours)  
- **Effect**: Restore 1d4 Heart HP and remove up to 2 emotional status effects.

---

## 🎭 Narrative Integration

GMs are encouraged to prompt trauma recovery scenes:

- After collapse due to HP depletion  
- In the aftermath of emotional or spiritual disasters  
- During quiet interludes between missions

**Bonus Fate Points** or **scene-specific bonuses** may be awarded for deep, roleplayed recovery moments.

---

## 🛡 Optional Traits & Blessings

Traits, items, or divine gifts may reduce trauma impact:

| Bonus Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Trait: Emotional Anchor** | Immune to `Numb`. Regain \+1 Heart/day with any support present |
| **Gear: Battle-Mind Conditioning** | \+1 die vs. trauma CVs in combat stress or mental attack |
| **Relic: Talisman of the Self** | Once per session, auto-succeed a Resolve recovery check |

---

This system ensures that mental and emotional recovery feels as real, risky, and rewarding as physical healing—while using your existing HP/status/skill structures.

## 💖 The Empathy System: Heart Mechanics, Bond Weighting, and Emotional Sync

### Overview

Empathy governs a character's ability to care, connect, support, and co-regulate with others. It powers trauma recovery, helper synchronization, stance interplay, and emotional resonance. It is the system through which players can:

- Create and repair Bonds
- Mimic emotional abilities or helper actions
- Cleanse status effects
- Empower others by syncing with their emotional state
- Absorb or share burdens
- Influence Presence non-aggressively

This system ensures Empathy is not just a support tool, but a mechanical force that rewards emotional intelligence.

---

### 🎯 Empathic Actions

Empathic actions are powered by Heart HP (governed by the Empathy attribute) and can be performed as standard or minor actions depending on their intensity.

| Action | Type | Cost | Effect |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Emotional Cleanse** | Minor | 1 Heart | Remove one minor status (e.g., Numb, Overstimulated) from another |
| **Support Sync** | Standard | 2 Heart | Ally gains advantage on next helper card or stance action |
| **Mimic Skill** | Standard | 3 Heart | Use a helper tag or Tier 0 action from an adjacent ally for 1 round |
| **Bond Anchor** | Reaction | 2 Heart | Prevent ally from collapse by absorbing 1 point of overflow damage (Presence or Heart only) |
| **Stance Reframe** | Minor | 1 Heart | Change your stance to match an ally's and gain +1d4 if bonded |

---

### 💓 Heart HP and Emotional Sync

Heart HP represents your emotional energy and availability.

**Healing**: Comfort, Counseling, Therapy, and downtime with bonded allies.

**Depletion**: Using Empathic actions, suffering emotional pressure, or sharing trauma.

**Recovery**: 1 HP/day in emotionally safe spaces or +1 per support skill check.

When Heart reaches 0, character gains the status **Numb** and cannot use empathy-based abilities until healed.

---

### 🧠 Emotional Pressure Table

| Trigger | Effect | Status Applied |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Witnessing ally collapse | 1 Heart loss | Haunted |
| Betrayal by Bonded NPC | 2 Heart loss | Fractured Bond |
| Social group exclusion | 1 Heart loss | Dismissed |
| Ongoing failure in support role | 1 Heart/scene | Doubtful |
| Successful shared emotional moment | +1 Heart | Inspired |

---

### 🔗 Bond Weighting System

Bonds are narrative ties with mechanical tags. Each Bond can carry one or more **Bond Tags**:

- **[Shared Past]** — Reroll 1 die on Trauma Support actions
- **[Protector]** — Can substitute for ally on Reaction if nearby
- **[Friction]** — Gain +2 to Insight rolls against them, but Heart actions cost +1
- **[Sacred]** — If they fall, gain Inspired or Despair (50/50)

Bond strength increases the effect of Empathic actions:

- **Weak Bond**: no effect
- **Moderate Bond**: +1d4 or reduced cost
- **Strong Bond**: +1d6 and status immunity transfer (once per day)

Bond formation, deepening, or rupture should be handled via narrative and supported by skills like Counseling, Comfort, or Mediation.

---

### 🌈 Emotional Mimicry ("Echo") Mechanic

Characters with high Empathy can temporarily mirror the traits or skills of bonded or nearby allies.

**Echo Action** (Standard, 3 Heart):
- Choose 1 adjacent ally
- Copy one skill you do not have (at 1 tier lower) or one helper card effect for 1 round
- If bonded, treat as full tier temporarily

This allows deeply empathetic characters to "fight like the fighter," "teach like the teacher," or "command like the commander" — once per moment of shared sync.

---

### 😔 Compassion Fatigue & Emotional Bleed

Repeated Empathic actions without rest or support lead to burnout.

| Fatigue Stage | Threshold | Consequence |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Winded** | Use 3+ empathic actions in a scene | Disadvantage on next Empathy roll |
| **Fractured** | Drop below 25% Heart HP | Risk transferring a status you remove (roll d6: 1–2 you gain it) |
| **Burned Out** | Heart HP 0 for 2+ scenes | All helper actions roll at -1 tier until recovery |

Fatigue clears after:
- Full rest in a safe space with bonded ally
- Use of Therapy or Recovery skills
- Spending 1 Fate Point for emotional catharsis

## Design Philosophy

### Universal Engagement

Every archetype provides meaningful helper cards that work across all challenge types. Combat characters can assist crafting through intimidation, knowledge characters can assist combat through strategic planning, etc.

### Scaling Complexity

Low-tier abilities focus on personal excellence and small-group coordination. High-tier abilities reshape encounters and reality itself while maintaining the same core mechanical framework.

### Collaborative Emphasis

Helper cards require skill rolls, ensuring that assistance isn't automatic. Good helpers become valuable party members, while poor helpers may hinder more than help.

### Archetype Identity

Each archetype's major ability captures their essential nature while scaling appropriately across all five power tiers. The system ensures that advancement always feels meaningful \- whether you're a Street-tier baker perfecting your craft or a Cosmic-tier reality-shaper rewriting the laws of physics, each level brings new capabilities and narrative authority.

# Chapter 10: Equipment, Wealth, and Survival

## 🎒 Introduction: Gear as Narrative Leverage

In *Socio-: Stories of Us*, equipment isn't just about stats — it's about **who you are, where you come from, and how you show up to help**. Weapons, tools, and clothing carry stories, status, and tactical options. Some make things easier. Others carry consequences. All matter.

This chapter avoids bloated tables. Instead, you'll find **functional categories**, **mechanical tags**, and **a visual weapon effectiveness matrix** rooted in **counterplay and coordination**.

## 🧵 Basic Necessities

| Item Type    | Cost Range   | Impact of Lacking It                         |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Clothing** | 1–50 credits | Gain "Exposed" status; +1 TV to social rolls |
| **Food**     | 1–10/day     | Gain "Winded" then "Exhausted"               |
| **Shelter**  | 5–1000+      | No HP recovery during rest; "Fatigued" tag   |
| **Water**    | 1/day        | "Dehydrated"; +1 CV to all actions           |

> These prices scale with generational wealth: someone born in poverty pays with labor or favors; someone elite pays in luxury currency.

## ⚔️ Weapon Effectiveness Matrix

Weapons are tools of strategy, not raw numbers. Each category **counters one**, **is countered by another**, and **has ideal environments**. Their **helper interactions and status effects** define their role.

### 🎯 Matrix Overview

> All items may be improved, damaged, passed on, or roleplayed into heirlooms. No item is just a number — it’s a narrative tool and socio-symbol.

---

## 💰 Economic Integration: The True Cost of Gear

Equipment isn't bought — it's **acquired through context**. What your character has depends on:

* Your **Generational Wealth** result
* Your **Craft or Trade** access
* Your **Community Ties or Helper Effects**

Characters from poverty might inherit tools, trade for food, or build their own weapons. Elites might have finery but lack practical gear. Story determines availability.

Let the Narrator interpret prices **as social relationships, favors owed, or trade conditions** — not just currency.

> “Your grandfather’s hammer might be worth more than a rich man’s sword — because you *know how to use it*.”


## Overview

In Socio-: Stories of Us, equipment is more than numbers on a sheet—it is social status, survival, and story. This chapter integrates the game's economic roots (see Generational Wealth, Chapter 1) with functional, flavorful gear and minimalist mechanics.

Rather than endless tables, this system presents equipment in intuitive categories, emphasizing narrative consequence, tactical identity, and player expression.

---

## 🧥 Starting Equipment: The Basics of Survival

Every character needs to address three foundational concerns:

- **Clothing** – Social acceptance, protection, style
- **Shelter** – A place to rest, recover, and be safe
- **Food** – Daily sustenance for physical and emotional well-being

### Clothing Tiers

| Tier | Name | Cost (Credits) | Description |
|------|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Rags | Free or 1 | Torn, insufficient for weather or decency |
| 2 | Commonwear | 5 | Basic outfit for blending in or labor |
| 3 | Tailored | 15 | Proper fit, adds grace or presence in most situations |
| 4 | Iconic Style | 30+ | Fashion, power, cultural statement (status modifiers apply) |

**Effect**: Wearing appropriate clothing grants advantage or reduces CVs in social encounters, stealth, or weather exposure.

### Shelter Options

| Tier | Name | Cost (per day or setup) | Notes |
|------|------|-------------------------|-------|
| 0 | None | 0 | Vulnerable, gain Exhausted unless aided |
| 1 | Shared Floor | 1 | Stable roof, limited privacy |
| 2 | Bed or Cot | 3 | Recover HP overnight, remove minor statuses |
| 3 | Private Room | 8 | Full recovery, narrative control, safe storage |
| 4 | Owned Home | 500+ (setup) | Customize, base-building, long-term safety |

Characters with no shelter begin accruing **Exhausted**, **Fragmented**, or **Numb** statuses unless supported by traits, skills, or allies.

### Food Access

| Type | Name | Cost (per day) | Effects |
|------|------|----------------|---------|
| 0 | None | 0 | Lose 1 HP/day (Focus or Might) |
| 1 | Scrap Meals | 1 | Fills stomach, no healing |
| 2 | Stable Diet | 3 | Heals minor HP loss with rest |
| 3 | Nourishing Meal | 6 | Clears 1 status (e.g., Winded, Haunted) |
| 4 | Shared Feast | 12+ | Group-wide morale bonus, Bond deepening |

---

## 💰 The Cost of Living

Characters from low wealth backgrounds begin with debt or scavenged gear. Those from middle-class backgrounds may start with decent equipment but little liquidity. Elite characters may begin play with owned housing, hired help, or signature gear.

Players are encouraged to narrate how they meet their daily needs:

- **Work a job** (Downtime Action: Labor, Craft, Performance)
- **Rely on a Bond** (Narrative tie that supports cost)
- **Scavenge/Steal/Forage** (Action roll required)
- **Enter Debt** (Narrative tag: Owed, possible antagonist creation)

---

## ⚔️ Weapon Categories and Tactical Matrix

We present a matrix-based approach to weapon logic based on battlefield dynamics, inspired by rock-paper-scissors gameplay.

### Combat Profile Matrix

| Weapon Type | Good Against | Weak To | Traits |
|-------------|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Swords** | Light infantry (peasants) | Archers, armor | Slashing, Versatile, Parryable |
| **Spears/Pikes** | Cavalry, tight formation | Archers, flanks | Piercing, Long Reach, Anti-Charge |
| **Bows/Crossbows** | Unarmored, unaware | Cavalry, shielded | Ranged, Slow Reload, Precise |
| **Maces/Axes** | Armored targets | Fast movers | Crushing, Armor-Breaker, Staggering |
| **Shields** | Ranged, crowd control | Heavy weapons | Defensive, Bash, Zone Control |

Each weapon has 2–3 tags that modify their behavior narratively and tactically.

Tags also interact with status effects:
- **Slashing**: Can inflict Bleeding
- **Crushing**: Can inflict Staggered or Wounded
- **Piercing**: Targets specific HP pools (e.g., Grace over Might)
- **Ranged**: Can trigger Surprised or avoid melee altogether

# Chapter 13 — Narrative Guidance

## Getting Started: Your First Session

### Explaining the Dice

Start by showing players the dice they'll use: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. Explain that higher numbers mean more sides, not necessarily "better"—a d20 gives more variability, while a d4 gives more consistency.

**Exploding Dice**: When you roll the maximum number on any die (6 on a d6, 20 on a d20), roll it again and add the results. This can chain indefinitely, creating those legendary moments when everything goes perfectly.

**Basic Resolution**: Roll your dice, add them up, compare to Target Value. Meet or exceed = success.

### Character Creation as Collaborative Worldbuilding

Don't rush through character creation. Each choice builds your shared world.

**Start with Generational Wealth**: Have everyone roll 3d20 for each parent. These results immediately tell you about your world's economic structure. Are most characters from poverty? Wealth? Mixed backgrounds? This shapes your entire campaign.

**Lifepath as Story**: As players move through the ten life stages, ask questions. When someone chooses "Childhood Friend" as a companion, who is that? Are they another player's character? An NPC you'll create? Each choice becomes a story hook.

**Note Bond Opportunities**: Players can purchase Bond companions with Fate Points during character creation. These relationships are mechanical—they'll affect gameplay through helper cards and emotional stakes. Make sure players understand Bonds aren't just background flavor.

## Running Encounters: When Dice Matter

### The Declaration Moment

An encounter begins when someone declares they're using a skill or attempting something with uncertain outcome. This is your cue to shift from conversation to structured play.

**The Flow**:
1. Player declares intent and method ("I want to convince the merchant using Rhetoric")
2. You set Target Value based on difficulty and circumstances
3. Call for initiative to determine order
4. Everyone declares their actions—what are they doing and how?
5. Resolve in order: Instant actions first, then Short, then Long

### Initiative and Action Coordination

Use the initiative questions from Chapter 8 to determine order. Rotate questions to keep spotlight moving:
- "Who has the most at stake here?"
- "Whose character would act fastest in this situation?"
- "Who brought snacks tonight?"

**The key insight**: Players act simultaneously but resolve in initiative order. Paul starts talking to the guard, everyone decides how to help, and Maria's prepared distraction becomes something entirely different when it actually happens.

### Managing Unknown Outcomes

This is where the game shines—and where many Narrators struggle. You don't know what will happen. Embrace this.

**Before the roll**: Establish stakes. What happens on success? On failure? Get everyone's expectations aligned.

**During the roll**: Let the dice and helper cards create unexpected combinations. The failed Intimidation roll combined with a successful Comfort helper might create a completely different scene than anyone planned.

**After the roll**: Narrate based on what actually happened, not what you expected. If the players' clever coordination produces an unexpectedly high result, let them have that victory. If they fail despite good planning, make the consequences interesting, not punitive.

### Action Scale Management

Different actions take different amounts of time, creating natural vulnerability and tactical choices.

**Instant Actions** (combat, quick responses): Everyone acts in initiative order within the same few seconds.

**Short Actions** (detailed work, negotiations): These span multiple rounds. Track who's committed to what—they can't switch to Instant actions while focused on their complex task.

**Long Actions** (crafting, research): Characters drop out of normal initiative flow. They're vulnerable to interruption and can't respond to immediate threats.

Use action scales to create meaningful choices. The baker who starts bread-making during a crisis can't also fight off attackers. The scholar deep in research can't notice the assassin approaching.

## Target Values: The Art of Challenge

Your Target Value tables (Chapter 6) are calibrated for dramatic tension, not simulation. Well-prepared characters should succeed about 50% of the time on Normal challenges.

**Consider the full context**:
- Character's skill level and gear
- Helper card bonuses they might receive
- Environmental advantages or disadvantages
- Coordination complexity if multiple people are involved

**Common mistake**: Setting TVs too high because you forget about helper bonuses. A "Normal" TV 8 challenge for a Street-tier character becomes much easier when they have three friends helping and good equipment.

## Social Stances: Managing the Flow

Social encounters use the same structure as physical ones, but with stances instead of weapons.

**Let players establish stances naturally**. When someone starts an emotional appeal, they're using Sympathy. When they present logical arguments, that's Convince. Don't make them declare "I'm using Convince stance"—just recognize it and apply the mechanics.

**NPCs declare stances last**. This gives players a chance to establish their approach before you decide how to respond. If three players are all using Sympathy, maybe your NPC shifts to Insight to cut through the emotional manipulation.

**Remember the counter-wheel**: Each stance beats one and loses to another. Use this to create dynamic conversations where different approaches work at different moments.

## HP Pools and Status Effects: More Than Hit Points

This game has eight different HP pools, each representing a different type of capacity. Players can be "defeated" in multiple ways—and recovery requires different approaches.

### Managing Multiple HP Pools

**Don't track every pool for every NPC**. Only use the HP pools that matter for the encounter. A social manipulator needs Will (Presence) and Heart (Empathy). A puzzle trap might target Psyche (Intellect). A physical laborer threatens Health (Might).

**Collapse consequences vary by pool**:
- **Health (Might) at 0**: Unconsciousness or death
- **Will (Presence) at 0**: Social withdrawal, loss of influence
- **Heart (Empathy) at 0**: Emotional shutdown, inability to connect
- **Focus (Resolve) at 0**: Mental breakdown, dissociation

**Each collapse reduces the governing attribute by 1** until healed through appropriate means. This isn't just mechanical—it's narrative weight. The character whose Will collapses isn't just "defeated," they're fundamentally changed.

### Status Effects as Story Tools

Status effects like Haunted, Numb, Inspired, or Wounded aren't just game mechanics—they're narrative cues. A character marked as Haunted carries emotional weight into future scenes. Someone who's Inspired acts differently than someone who's Afraid.

**Apply status effects generously**. They create story momentum and give players concrete things to address. The Helper Cards in Empathy and Resolve skills specifically target status removal—let those systems work.

**Environmental status effects** can define entire scenes. A tense negotiation might apply Overstimulated to everyone. A sacred space might grant Inspired. A cursed location could inflict Haunted on entry.

## Bonds: The Heart of Collaboration

Bonds are relationships with mechanical weight. They're not just background—they're required for many advanced techniques players can purchase with Fate Points.

### Creating and Defining Bonds

**Bonds form through shared experience**, not just declaration. Two characters who survive a crisis together develop a Bond. A character who consistently provides healing to the same person creates a Bond. The scholar who teaches someone over weeks forms a Bond.

**Each Bond has tags that define its nature**:
- **[Shared Past]**: History together, grants rerolls on trauma support
- **[Protector]**: One shields the other, can substitute on reactions
- **[Friction]**: Complicated relationship, bonus to Insight but higher costs
- **[Sacred]**: Deep spiritual connection, collapse affects both parties

**Bond strength matters mechanically**:
- **Weak Bond**: No mechanical effect, pure narrative
- **Moderate Bond**: +1d4 bonus dice or reduced costs on related actions
- **Strong Bond**: +1d6 bonus dice and status immunity transfer

### Using Bonds in Play

**Bonds activate when relevant**. If two Bonded characters are working together on something that touches their relationship, the Bond provides mechanical benefits. The protector gets bonuses when defending their ward. Childhood friends gain advantages when supporting each other's goals.

**Bonds can be damaged or broken**. Betrayal, neglect, or fundamental disagreement can reduce Bond strength or add negative tags like [Fractured] or [Betrayed]. This isn't punishment—it's story development.

**NPCs can have Bonds with PCs**. The tavern keeper who's grateful for past help. The mentor who taught a character their trade. These relationships provide narrative weight and mechanical support when relevant.

## Helper Cards: Coordinating Chaos

Helper Cards represent specific techniques for assisting others. They're not just mechanical bonuses—they're collaborative storytelling tools.

### When to Use Helper Cards

**Someone must declare they're helping** before you determine what help is available. "I want to help Maria with her negotiation" triggers the system. Then you determine what kind of help is possible based on skills, positioning, and circumstances.

**The helper rolls first**. Their success determines the quality of assistance they can provide. Failed help often makes things worse—the nervous ally who tries to back up your intimidation attempt but clearly has no idea what they're doing.

**Coordination Complexity adjusts the Target Value** based on how difficult the collaboration is. Simple assistance (+1 to TV) versus complex coordination requiring precise timing (+3 or more to TV).

### Managing Helper Interactions

**Multiple helpers can stack**, but coordination complexity increases rapidly. Two people helping means more communication overhead. Three or more requires exceptional coordination or starts becoming counterproductive.

**Different archetypes help in different ways**. The Combat specialist provides flanking and intimidation. The Knowledge specialist provides research and analysis. The Support specialist provides encouragement and healing.

**Cross-archetype helping works but is harder**. The scholar can help the warrior by providing tactical analysis, but it's more complex than another warrior providing flanking support.

## Campaign Pacing and Structure

### Session Structure

**Begin with connections**. Start each session by checking in on Bonds, ongoing projects, and character goals. This isn't just social time—it establishes the emotional stakes for what follows.

**Use the three-encounter structure**:
1. **Opening encounter**: Establishes the session's stakes and tone
2. **Development encounter**: Complicates the situation, reveals new information
3. **Resolution encounter**: Addresses the session's central conflict

**End with consequences**. Show how the session's events affect the world and relationships. Bonds strengthen or weaken. Status effects carry forward. Actions have lasting impact.

### Long-term Play

**Characters grow through use**. The advancement system rewards characters for actually using their skills. Don't artificially limit this—let characters develop in the directions they're naturally growing.

**Tier advancement changes everything**. Moving from Street to City tier isn't just getting stronger—it's becoming a different kind of person who faces different kinds of problems. Use this to evolve your campaign's scope and stakes.

**Bonds evolve**. Relationships that start as simple cooperation can become deep spiritual connections. Former enemies can become trusted allies. Let these changes drive long-term story development.

## Managing Different Archetypes

Each archetype creates different spotlight moments and needs different types of challenges.

### Combat Specialists

**Give them tactical choices**, not just "roll to hit." Positioning matters. Protecting allies matters. The environment matters. A hallway fight plays differently than an open courtyard.

**Use their intimidation socially**. Physical presence affects negotiations. Sometimes the unspoken threat is more powerful than eloquent words.

**Let them protect others**. Combat specialists often see their role as shield for the group. Create moments where this matters—when the scholar needs time to research, when the crafter needs space to work.

### Knowledge Specialists

**Information is their weapon**. Give them mysteries to solve, patterns to recognize, histories that matter to current events. Let research and analysis drive story development.

**Make their teaching valuable**. Knowledge specialists can share skills and provide tactical advantages through better planning and preparation.

**Research takes time**. Use the action scale system—while the knowledge specialist spends hours in the library, other characters handle the immediate crisis. Then the research pays off later.

### Support Specialists

**Healing is more than HP restoration**. Status effect removal, trauma recovery, and emotional support drive story development. Let them be the heart of group resilience.

**They coordinate others**. Support specialists often become party coordinators, managing helper card interactions and keeping everyone working together effectively.

**Show the cost of care**. The empathy system has built-in burnout mechanics. Let supporters face compassion fatigue and need support themselves.

### Social Specialists

**Every NPC is a potential scene**. Social specialists turn random encounters into relationship opportunities. Be ready to develop NPCs on the fly.

**Networks matter**. Their contacts and reputation provide story hooks and resource access. Let past social investments pay off in unexpected ways.

**Social consequences persist**. Reputation damage or relationship betrayals have lasting mechanical effects through the Bond system.

### Physical Specialists

**The world is their playground**. Environmental mastery means they find routes others can't, survive conditions others can't, and turn terrain into advantage.

**They enable group mobility**. Getting everyone across the chasm, through the storm, or up the cliff becomes their specialty.

**Survival skills drive exploration**. Let them guide the group through dangerous territory, find resources, and read environmental dangers.

## Equipment and Wealth Integration

### Making Generational Wealth Matter

**Starting equipment reflects background**. The wealthy character begins with quality gear and social connections. The poor character starts with resourcefulness and street knowledge.

**Wealth affects problem-solving approaches**. Rich characters might hire help or buy their way out of problems. Poor characters improvise, trade favors, or find alternative solutions.

**Economic pressure creates story**. Characters who need money have different motivations than those who don't. Use this disparity to drive interpersonal dynamics.

### Equipment as Story Tool

**Gear tells stories**. The heirloom sword, the handmade tools, the fancy clothes—each piece of equipment represents character history and values.

**Quality matters mechanically**. Better tools provide bonuses, but often come with social expectations or maintenance requirements.

**Loss and damage have weight**. When the master craftsman's tools break, it's not just mechanical inconvenience—it's emotional trauma requiring recovery.

## Character Age Variations

The lifepath system assumes characters reach young adulthood, but you can modify this.

### Younger Characters

**Stop the lifepath early** for child or teenage characters. Give them fewer total attribute points but possibly higher individual scores in their areas of focus.

**Add innocence and impulsiveness**. Younger characters might have more Fate Points to represent their openness to possibility, but less Resolve to represent their inexperience with hardship.

**Growth during play matters more**. Young characters should develop faster, gaining skills and attributes through play experience.

### Older Characters

**Add post-lifepath experiences**. Give additional Fate Points and skill points proportional to years past 20. Someone who's 40 has had twenty more years of experience.

**Consider life baggage**. Older characters might start with more Bonds, but also more complicated relationships and past obligations.

**Physical versus mental development**. An older scholar might have incredible Lore and Intellect but declining Might and Grace.

## Handling Failure and Consequences

### Failure Drives Story Forward

**"No, but..." and "Yes, and..."** structures keep narrative momentum. Complete failure often stops story cold—partial success with complications keeps things moving.

**Failed rolls reveal information**. The failed lockpicking attempt makes noise, attracting attention. The failed negotiation reveals the NPC's true motivations.

**Consequences ripple outward**. Failed actions affect Bonds, reputation, resources, and future opportunities. Track these effects across sessions.

### Types of Consequences

**Immediate consequences** happen right now. The guard notices you. The rope breaks. The spell fails catastrophically.

**Delayed consequences** appear later. The merchant remembers your insult. The rushed repair job fails at the worst moment. The lie catches up to you.

**Relationship consequences** affect Bonds and social connections. Betraying trust, failing to help when needed, or competing interests can damage relationships mechanically.

**Resource consequences** affect equipment, wealth, health, or status effects. These create ongoing pressure and force difficult choices.

## Magic System Integration

If you're using the optional magic system:

### Magic as Arms Race

**Low-tier magic is expensive and slow**. Beginning mages sacrifice everything for small effects. This creates interesting resource management and vulnerability windows.

**Mastery changes everything**. High-tier mages can cast low-level effects easily while working on reality-reshaping rituals. This creates natural character progression.

**Specialization matters**. Magic paths lock each other out, creating meaningful character choices and party dynamics.

**Collaboration amplifies power**. Ritual magic works best with multiple participants, reinforcing the game's cooperative themes.

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Players Don't Coordinate

**Solution**: Use coordination complexity to make solo approaches harder. Reward helper card use with better outcomes. Create challenges that require multiple skill types.

### Problem: Social Encounters Feel Mechanical

**Solution**: Let stances emerge naturally from roleplay. Don't announce "I'm using Convince stance"—just recognize when logical arguments appear and apply the mechanics.

### Problem: Combat Specialists Overshadow Others

**Solution**: Use the action scale system. While the warrior handles immediate threats, others work on longer-term solutions. Both approaches matter.

### Problem: Too Many Status Effects to Track

**Solution**: Only track status effects that matter to current scenes. Let minor effects fade naturally. Focus on status effects that drive story development.

### Problem: Players Avoid Difficult Challenges

**Solution**: Make the stakes clear. Show what happens if they don't act. Use Bond relationships and character values to make avoidance impossible.

## NPC Creation and Management

### Quick NPC Generation

**Only stat what matters**. A social manipulator needs Presence and Empathy. A physical threat needs Might and Grace. Don't create full character sheets for brief encounters.

**Give NPCs one distinctive trait**. The nervous laugh, the perfect posture, the habit of quoting poetry. Players remember personality more than statistics.

**Use the threat templates** from Chapter 13 for antagonists, but remember that most NPCs aren't threats—they're people with their own goals and problems.

### Developing NPCs During Play

**Let player interest drive development**. If players keep interacting with the innkeeper, develop their backstory and motivations. If they ignore the lord's advisor, keep them simple.

**NPCs form Bonds too**. Grateful merchants, respected mentors, loyal students—these relationships provide story hooks and mechanical support.

**Show NPC agency**. NPCs pursue their own goals when players aren't around. The world continues moving, creating new situations and opportunities.

> *Not every threat wields a sword. Some wear uniforms. Some cry in your voice. Some manifest when the bread goes moldy.*

In *Socio-: Stories of Us*, threats do not need stat blocks as vast as player characters — but they do need to matter. Opponents are generated only for the points where they interact meaningfully with the systems: emotional weight, tactical friction, narrative consequence. They use the same attributes, HP pools, stances, and even helper-style abilities — just simplified, cardboard shadows of reality until tested.

---

### 📐 Opponent Template Anatomy

Each template includes:

- **Name / Concept**
- **Tier & Threat Value (TV)** — TV = 3 per Tier 1 opponent
- **Attributes** — Only those that matter
- **HP Pools** — Only those targeted or tested
- **Stances** — Preferred or reactive
- **Abilities** — Helper-like effects or unique triggers
- **Tags** — Persistent properties, like `[Armored]`, `[Crowd]`, `[Persistent]`
- **Status Triggers** — Conditions or turning points

---

### ⚠️ Encounter Design Notes

Players and threats act in the same **initiative phase**. Opponents **declare stances last**, giving players a chance to build toward emotional or tactical leverage.

Use the Threat Value (TV) system to balance encounters:

- Tier 1 PC ≈ TV 3  
- Tier 2 PC ≈ TV 6  
- Tier 3 PC ≈ TV 9+

**Example**: 3 Tier 1 PCs = TV 9 encounter  
Options:  
- 3 Tier 1 threats (TV 3 × 3)  
- 1 Tier 2 elite (TV 6) + 1 Supporter (TV 3)

> *"Not every threat wields a weapon. Some wear silence. Some echo in your voice. Some rise when the bread goes stale."*

This chapter contains the full framework for designing meaningful opposition in *Socio-: Stories of Us*. Threats are not merely statblocks — they are reflections of story pressure, emotional weight, social power, and systemic inertia. They use the same 10 Attributes, HP pool system, stances, statuses, and (simplified) helper-like abilities as players — but are designed for focus, friction, and flow.

Opposition defines the stakes. This chapter shows how to craft it well.

---

### 🧠 I. The Philosophy of Threats

A threat in *Socio-* exists to:

* ✴ *Surface player values* (what are they willing to protect?)
* ✴ *Test the systems* (social stance, exhaustion, HP attrition, helper cards)
* ✴ *Advance the narrative through consequence* (not just challenge, but change)

You will find no monolithic evil here. The dragon may be fear. The villain may be the mother’s grief you never faced. Or the mob. Or the law.

Your goal: Create threats that interact with **emotion**, **systems**, and **stakes**.

---

### ⚡ II. Quick Rules: Building an Opponent

Use this for fast creation in scene or downtime:

**STEP 1:** Determine the *Threat Role* (see below)
**STEP 2:** Assign only the attributes and HP pools that matter
**STEP 3:** Choose a primary stance or stance pattern
**STEP 4:** Add 1–2 helper-like effects or status triggers
**STEP 5:** Assign **Tier** and calculate **TV (Threat Value)**

📏 **Threat Value (TV) Guide:**

* Tier 1 = TV 3
* Tier 2 = TV 6
* Tier 3 = TV 9
* Elite Threat = +1–3 TV

🎯 *Match total TV of opposition to total TV of player party.*

🌀 NPCs act during the same initiative phase as players. All declare stances together. NPCs **go last** in execution order.

---

### 🎭 III. Threat Roles

Each threat should be built with an intended *interaction style*. Here are the core types:

* **🗡 Aggressor** — Targets HP directly (physical, emotional, or cognitive)
* **🕸 Controller** — Imposes statuses, modifies positioning, controls tempo
* **🧨 Disruptor** — Breaks player action economy, denies Bonds or cards
* **🛡 Tank** — Soaks damage, reflects pressure, hard to ignore
* **🪞 Mirror** — Replicates player values, powers, or pain

You can combine roles — but always know what gameplay moment the threat creates.

---

### 🏷️ IV. Tags — The Language of Threats

Tags are persistent descriptors that define how a threat behaves, endures, or affects the world. Unlike statuses (which are temporary and reactive), **tags are always on**.

| Tag            | Effect                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[Armored]`    | Reduces all incoming physical HP loss by 1. Bypassed by `[Piercing]` or `[Magic]`.                                   |
| `[Crowd]`      | Acts as one entity until separated. Area effects impact all. If split, treat as individuals.                         |
| `[Persistent]` | Cannot be removed from the scene by normal means. Requires resolution (e.g., social win, exposure, systemic change). |
| `[Haunted]`    | Applies `[Numb]` if a player interacts with it using a *Sympathy* stance.                                            |
| `[Unnatural]`  | Immune to `[Afraid]` and `[Wounded]`. Vulnerable to `[Inspired]`.                                                    |
| `[Internal]`   | Must be faced by a player alone unless narratively dispelled. Cannot be flanked or assisted.                         |
| `[Mirrored]`   | Copies a PC’s stance or skill tier once per round.                                                                   |
| `[Entitled]`   | Treats any contradiction as a social attack. Gains +d4 to Convince or Command checks.                                |
| `[Reactive]`   | Changes stance to match the last stance used against it.                                                             |

Tags can be added, removed, or revealed as narrative tools. You are encouraged to create new ones for factions, regions, or rare phenomena.

---

### ⚠️ V. Status Triggers & Thresholds

Threats apply statuses not just through actions, but through emotional weight, environmental control, or collapse states.

**Common trigger types:**

* ⬇️ *Threshold Trigger* — At half HP, the threat causes a status (e.g., panic, rally, unleash)
* 💢 *Stance Clash* — Inflict a status when the threat's stance beats the player’s
* 🎭 *Narrative Cue* — Scene-based causes (e.g., a ritual completing, a secret revealed)

| Trigger                                    | Status Applied                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Fails Convince roll three times in a scene | `[Afraid]` from public rejection             |
| Collapses Psyche pool                      | `[Numb]` or `[Haunted]`, depending on source |
| Loses social standing (Will 0)             | `[Wounded]` to Bonds or Presence             |
| Is ignored when using *Command* stance     | `[Inspired]` (player) or `[Winded]` (threat) |

Use these as scene design tools — not just mechanics.

---

### 🧟 VI. Swarms & Collective Threats

Some threats do not arrive alone. Mobs, bureaucracies, infestations, grief-echoes — these swarm in numbers but act as one.

* ☁️ **Swarms share HP pools and attributes.** They are one threat until disrupted.
* 💥 **Area effects hit all.** Bond actions or group effects affect the whole.
* 🔀 **If separated**, a single unit may break off and become its own opponent. Assign its stats then.
* 🧩 **Narrators may use stances to scatter or manipulate group flow.**

| Example     | Tactic                                                                                              |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Angry Mob   | Treat as `[Crowd]` using *Command* and *Follow* stances. Scatter if made to feel shame (Will loss). |
| Rumor Swarm | Insight-based swarm with `[Shifting]` tag. Adapts to repeated actions.                              |

Narratively, swarms reflect pressure without intent. They’re not evil — they’re momentum.

---

### 🤝 VII. NPC Helper-Like Abilities

Threats do not use full helper cards, but they may act with sudden insight or pressure.

**Format:** *Once per scene or condition, the threat may...*

| Name                      | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Form 38-F*               | Deny one PC’s action for 1 round unless they pass an Awareness + Lore check. |
| *Tidal Logic*             | Gain Advantage when targeted by the same stance twice in a round.            |
| *Memory Siphon*           | Force a choice: reveal a secret, or take `[Numb]`.                           |
| *Soft Words, Hard Chains* | If a PC chooses *Follow*, they take 1 HP damage to Resolve next round.       |
| *Griefquake*              | All PCs with unresolved Bonds take 1 Heart HP damage.                        |

These effects should be **memorable**, **specific**, and **tied to theme**. They’re not “balanced” — they are sparks.

---

### 🏁 VIII. Collapse States & Aftermath

A threat rarely dies clean. Collapse is an opportunity — a moment of change.

📉 When a threat reaches 0 HP in a pool:

* Choose a **collapse effect**: they flee, freeze, beg, explode, confess, replicate, collapse inward.
* If `[Persistent]`, they remain. Their influence lingers. Their effect may become environmental.

✨ Use the collapse to:

* Reveal new information
* Trigger emotional fallout
* Shift player stance or identity

🕊 Players should survive. A threat is meaningful only when you live to carry its scars.

---

### 🧰 IX. DIY Threat Template Block

Use this block to build your own:

**Name:**
**Tier / TV:**
**Role:** 🗡 / 🕸 / 🧨 / 🛡 / 🪞
**Attributes Used:**
**HP Pools:**
**Tags:**

## Now You're Ready to Play

**Everyone chosen a character?** Great! The scenario begins below. 

**Narrator:** Read "The Merchant's Dilemma" setup aloud to establish the situation. Players will naturally declare actions as the crisis unfolds - use the Reference Summary to handle dice rolls and helper actions.

**Players:** Don't worry about playing "optimally." Focus on what your character would do and look for ways to help others succeed. The game rewards cooperation over individual heroics.

---

# Quick Start Scenario: "The Merchant's Dilemma"

## Setup: What They're Trying to Achieve

The characters have arrived in the market town of Millhaven seeking supplies and safe passage to their next destination. Elena is negotiating with Merchant Caravan Master Thaddeus Crow for transport, while the others wait nearby. The negotiation is going well - Elena has established good rapport using her Social Grace and cultural knowledge.

**Then the interruption happens.**

## The Interruption: Crisis Erupts

A young woman bursts into the market square, crying "Thieves! Murderers! They killed my father!" She points directly at your group. Behind her, an angry crowd of 20+ townspeople begins forming, led by the local blacksmith who's shouting "Strangers bring nothing but trouble!"

**Narrator:** *"You have seconds before this becomes a mob. The merchant Crow steps back from Elena nervously. What do you want to do?"*

This is when structured play begins.

## Step 1: Initiative Determination

**Narrator asks the initiative question:** *"Who has the most to lose if this goes badly?"*

Players discuss and decide. Likely candidates:
- **Elena** (her negotiation is falling apart)
- **Jim** (as the leader, he feels responsible)  
- **Dr. Sarah** (as healer, she's most concerned about violence)

**Result:** Let's say Elena wins initiative - she has the most immediate stake in the situation.

## Step 2: Declaration Phase

In initiative order, each player declares their intended action:

**Elena:** "I want to use my Negotiation skill to calm the situation - find out what actually happened."

**Marcus:** "I'm going to try to help Elena by using my Social Grace - maybe make us look less threatening."

**Kass:** "I want to position myself to protect everyone, but not look aggressive. Athletics to move into a defensive position?"

**Dr. Sarah:** "I want to read the crowd's emotions - see how angry they really are versus how scared."

**Jim:** "I want to help Elena by using my community connections - do I know anyone here? Networking skill."

## Step 3: Target Values and Coordination

**Narrator determines challenges:**

- **Elena's Negotiation:** TV 12 (Normal difficulty + crowd tension + accusation stress)
- **Marcus helping Elena:** TV 8 (coordination with Social Grace) 
- **Kass's positioning:** TV 6 (straightforward Athletics)
- **Sarah's emotion reading:** TV 10 (crowd is mixed emotions)
- **Jim's networking:** TV 8 (small town, he might know someone)

**Coordination Complexity:** Elena gets +2 to her TV (now 14) because multiple people are helping, but she'll get bonus dice if the helpers succeed.

## Step 4: Resolution Phase

Everyone rolls simultaneously:

**Kass (Athletics):** Rolls d8, gets 6. Success! Moves into protective position without seeming threatening.

**Jim (Networking):** Rolls d6, gets 4. Fails. Doesn't recognize anyone who could vouch for them.

**Marcus (Social Grace):** Rolls d8, gets 7. Success! His refined appearance and calm demeanor makes Elena seem more trustworthy. Grants Elena +1d4 bonus die.

**Sarah (Reading Emotions):** Rolls d10, gets 8. Success! She realizes the crowd is more scared than angry - they're reacting to fear, not hatred.

**Elena (Negotiation + bonus die):** Rolls d12+d4, gets 9+3=12. Exactly meets her TV of 14? No, wait - her TV was increased to 14 by coordination complexity, so she fails by 2.

## Step 5: Narrator Describes Results

**Narrator:** *"Elena, your words are reasonable but the crowd isn't listening to reason right now. Sarah, you can see they're terrified - something has them genuinely frightened, not just angry at strangers. Marcus, your calm presence keeps things from getting worse, but you notice Merchant Crow backing further away. Kass, you're in position to act if this turns violent. Jim, nobody here recognizes you - you're all outsiders to them."*

*"The young woman continues crying, 'They came to our farm last night! Strangers just like these!' The blacksmith raises his hammer and shouts, 'We won't let it happen again!'"*

*"This is escalating. What's your next move?"*

## Step 6: Second Round - New Information Changes Strategy

Now players understand this isn't about them specifically - something happened to frighten the town, and they're being blamed by association.

**Initiative question:** *"Who is most likely to get to the truth here?"*

**Elena:** "I want to change to an Insight stance - figure out what really happened instead of just trying to calm them."

**Dr. Sarah:** "I want to help by using my Psychology skill to understand what traumatized the young woman."

**Jim:** "Can I use Teaching to help Elena by asking the right questions - like a community mediator would?"

**Marcus:** "I want to examine the young woman's clothes - maybe my Fashion knowledge can tell us something about where she's really from?"

**Kass:** "I'm staying ready to protect everyone, but I want to use my Danger Sense - is there a real threat we should know about?"

## Step 7: Investigation Round Resolution

This round goes better because they're working with the situation instead of against it:

**Sarah (Psychology) helping Elena:** Rolls d8, gets 6. Success! Realizes the woman is traumatized but also coached - someone told her what to say.

**Marcus (Fashion):** Rolls d6, gets 5. Success! Her dress is expensive - too expensive for a farmer's daughter.

**Jim (Teaching) helping Elena:** Rolls d8, gets 7. Success! Provides framework for Elena to ask better questions.

**Kass (Danger Sense):** Rolls d8, gets 6. Success! Notices armed figures moving through the crowd who aren't locals.

**Elena (Insight + multiple helpers):** Gets +1d4 from Sarah, +1d4 from Jim. Rolls d10+d4+d4, gets 8+2+3=13 vs TV 10. Success!

## Step 8: The Truth Emerges and Resolution

**Narrator:** *"Elena, your careful questions reveal inconsistencies in the woman's story. Sarah, you recognize signs of coaching and fear - she's been told what to say by someone who frightened her. Marcus, that dress cost more than a farmer makes in a year. Jim, your systematic questioning creates doubt in the crowd. Kass, you spot three armed figures who definitely aren't townspeople moving to surround you."*

*"Suddenly, Merchant Crow steps forward: 'Wait! I know those men - they work for my competitor, Merchant Vex. He's been trying to sabotage my routes!' The young woman breaks down crying, 'He said he'd hurt my real family if I didn't do this!'"*

**The threat is no longer relevant** because:
- The truth is revealed
- The crowd's anger redirects toward the real culprits  
- The characters are cleared of suspicion
- Merchant Crow is grateful and offers better terms
- The armed figures flee rather than face the now-hostile crowd

## What This Scenario Demonstrates

**For New Players:**
- **Initiative questions** create natural turn order
- **Helper cards** let everyone contribute meaningfully  
- **Social stances** (Negotiation → Insight) matter tactically
- **Different skills** solve the same problem different ways
- **Coordination** has costs but provides benefits
- **Investigation** can be as exciting as combat

**For Narrators:**
- Set Target Values based on story needs, not simulation
- Let failure reveal new information instead of stopping progress
- Use the threat templates (this was the Social Manipulator pattern)
- Multiple helper attempts create natural collaboration
- Resolution comes from understanding, not just success

**Character Showcases:**
- **Elena:** Social leadership and adaptability  
- **Marcus:** Unexpected knowledge proving valuable
- **Sarah:** Reading people and providing support
- **Jim:** Community-building and systematic thinking
- **Kass:** Protective awareness and tactical positioning

## Narrator Notes

**Pacing:** This scenario should take 45-60 minutes, giving players time to understand the systems without rushing.

**Adaptation:** Change the merchant, town, and accusation to fit your setting. The structure works for any "mistaken identity leading to mob anger" situation.

**Follow-up:** This naturally leads to either:
- Helping rescue the young woman's real family
- Investigating Merchant Vex's sabotage operation  
- Continuing travel with Merchant Crow's grateful assistance

The key is starting with a clear goal (negotiation), introducing urgent interruption (false accusation), and resolving through collaboration and investigation rather than force.

## 📦 Appendix: For Designers, Modders, and Dreamers

> *"This system was built not as a fortress, but as a foundation. What you build on top of it is your story now."*

Welcome. If you’re reading this section, you’re likely a fellow designer, developer, or storyteller with ideas of your own. *Socio-: Stories of Us* was made to be forked, adapted, reskinned, expanded, and sold. This appendix outlines how to do so with clarity, legality, and creative integrity.

### 🔀 Ways to Expand or Fork

You can build on *Socio-* in any of these ways—or forge your own path:

| Fork Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Setting Overlay** | Introduce your own world, factions, history, and tone. Keep core mechanics intact. |
| **Thematic Remix** | Shift genre emphasis—e.g. horror, utopia, sci-fi, magic-realism—while using lifepath and helper systems. |
| **Module Creation** | Add specific systems: magic, warfare, vehicles, politics, crafting trees, faction tools. |
| **One-Shot Adventures** | Design scenarios using existing rules. Showcase the system’s social dynamics and helper cards. |
| **New Helper Cards** | Create custom tools for niche roles, team synergies, or magical interactions. |
| **Trait & Tag Packs** | Expand narrative tools with mechanics for identity, ideology, or transformation. |
| **Alt Progression Tracks** | Replace tiers with thematic milestones (e.g. Mythic Journeys, Corporate Ascension, Divine Awakening). |
| **Solo Mode / GMless Variants** | Build interpretive engines for emergent storytelling using player-led systems. |
| **Digital Tools** | Create apps, generators, SRDs, or character builders to support the ecosystem. |

### ⚖️ What *Not* to Do

While you're encouraged to remix freely, please avoid:

- **Implying official endorsement** without explicit permission  
- **Reskinning without credit** (CC BY requires attribution even for heavy remixes)  
- **Disregarding core safety principles** (you can change tone, but do not publish tools that encourage harm or remove consent structures)  

We don’t gatekeep content—but we *do* care about ethical design.

---

### 🔮 Intentions Behind the System

If you’re adapting *Socio-*, keep in mind what it was built for:

- **Cooperation over competition**  
- **Mechanics that reward interdependence**  
- **Emotional intelligence as tactical depth**  
- **Accessibility without infantilization**  
- **A place for systems thinkers, poets, survivors, and builders to feel seen**  

It’s okay to drift from that, but understand: *the bones of this system remember what it was made for*. If your story is different, own that difference proudly.

---

### 📚 Developer Tools (Coming Soon)

We plan to release:

- **A Designer’s SRD (System Reference Document)** with stripped-down mechanics  
- **Pre-built templates** for helper cards, archetypes, skill trees  
- **Threat & Tag libraries** to support expansion  
- **Fork Spotlights** showcasing great community adaptations  

Stay tuned at **[your website or GitHub]**, or email **[your contact]** if you want to contribute early.

## 🧭 The Forker's Code

This code is not a rulebook. It is a guidepost—a values-rooted reminder of what Socio-: Stories of Us was built for.

You are invited to fork this system if you:

- 🎴 Create meaningfully — not just reskin, but remix, reframe, reimagine
- 🤝 Attribute openly — your creativity shines brighter when it honors its roots
- 🛡️ Respect consent — in play, in tone, in the stories you invite others into
- ❤️ Honor Love as a design principle — build systems that care for people
- 🧠 Promote Truth through transparency, clarity, and mechanical coherence
- ⚖️ Embrace Balanced Accountability — especially in collaborative and adversarial play
- 🌱 Consider Well-being and Sustainability — in the content you create and its impact
- 🕸️ Build Community — by inviting others in, not gatekeeping them out
- 🔍 Innovate — not to be new for novelty's sake, but to serve what the moment asks
- 🕊️ Protect Freedom — of imagination, expression, and creative autonomy

The fork is not a betrayal.  
It is the continuation of the story.

Go forth and make stories of us.

### ✊ The Fork is the Point

The system you now hold was not built to be sacred.  
It was built to be *shared*.  

If you remix this game and make it more kind, more sharp, more strange, more yours—we’ve already succeeded.

**Make stories of us.**
